It is hoped that these \ntremendous political, social and economic changes will spur our own lagging \ndemocratic movement and domestic revolution. \n\n\nIt is too easy to be smug and look upon this country as a peerless example of \ndemocracy in action. However, poverty and injustice are not the hallmarks of \ndemocracy. Statistics on minorities at all levels of life point to the need for \ncontinuation of our own civil-rights movement. \n\n\nAmerica has not successfully addressed the growing gap between the haves and \nthe have-nots. We have yet to confront the remaining areas of discrimination in \nour society. To continue to lead the democratic world, we must re-double our \nefforts and commit our resources. \n\n\nAn aggressive Congress is a major component of America's rededication to this \ngoal. As the first item on its agenda, Congress must commit itself to undo the \ndamage done to the cause of equality by the U.S. Supreme Court in its last \nterm. Bipartisan congressional leadership has undertaken to do that with a \nmajor new civil-rights bill. \n\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1990 seeks to remove the tremendous obstacles and \nburdens that several Supreme Court decisions imposed on the laws related to job \ndiscrimination. The bill places the burden of proof on the employer, provides \ngreater protection against racial harassment on the job and protects against \nretroactive changes to court-approved affirmative-action plans. It would go a \nlong way toward restoring the commitments regarding job discrimination made to \nminorities and women in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and in a 1966 \namendment.. \n\n\nBoth congressional and civil-rights leaders across the country recognize that \nthe Supreme Court, with its new conservative majority, is a tremendous threat \nto women, minorities and the poor. This majority has served notice that it has \nlittle or no regard for the clear, unmistakable discrimination that many \ncontinue to face. It is equally clear that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor will not \nbe a voice for women's rights or any other minority position. She is an \"old \nboy\" in the truest meaning of the phrase. \n\n\nThe 1960s in this country served as the historical precedent for Congress \nacting to address injustice. It is only when the people insist on change, as \nthey did then and as they have done in other countries recently, that it comes \nabout. \n\n\nI was an early prodder and beneficiary of an activist Congress. When I was 10, \nmy mother announced that we were going to join the civil rights movement. As a \nwriter, she felt she must witness and record the greatest social movement of \nher lifetime. \n\n\nWe traveled by automobile, my five brothers and sisters, mother and I. There \nwere to be six trips between 1960 and 1965. For all but the last, we had to \nreroute our trips to include those cities that had Negro motels and restaurants \nbecause we could not stay, or be served, at any other facility. Only in 1964, \nafter Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, did unrestricted and fully \naccessible public accommodations become the law of the land, and we would map a \ntrip without regard to the four or five black motels and restaurants between \nCalifornia and Montgomery, Ala. \n\n\nThe 1990s show every indication of being a startling decade. Among the most \nimportant ways Congress can provide justice in America is to pass the Civil \nRights Act of 1990, and insist on the recognition of the new global realities \nby making huge cuts in the defense budget, particularly in the acquisition of \nweapons systems. These funds can then be invested in human beings; laws \ndesigned to provide for the rights and betterment of our citizens mean little \nwithout resources. \n\n\nCongress must help establish the national consensus necessary to divert our \neconomic resources from weapons and armies to job training, shelter, education, \nhealth and child care. The lesson for America in all we have observed lately is \nthat we must get in line with the worldwide democratic movement and provide \nmaximum freedom and opportunity for its own."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0010", "docId": "179412", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Metro; Part B; Page 7; Column 1; Op-Ed Desk", "length": "651", "headline": "IN MONUMENTS OF DESPAIR, A RAY OF HOPE;", "byline": "By MADELEINE R.

All too \noften, what seemed like perfectly good buildings on the outside had become \nwalled ghettos for gangs, drugs and poverty. \n\n\nLos Angeles is about to implement some pioneering measures to remedy that sort \nof thing and, perhaps, to see that it is not repeated here anymore. \n\n\nLast November, the Los Angeles City Housing Authority announced plans to locate \nsocial services and social workers in public housing projects. This proposal \nmerits careful attention and support from all who are concerned about some of \ntoday's most pressing social problems. \n\n\nOne of the bitter ironies of our time is that a significant portion of homeless \npeople are alumni, as it were, of public housing projects. \n\n\nThe Federal Housing Act of 1949 enunciated the goal of a decent home and \nsuitable environment for every American family. But it has taken all these \nyears to drive home the lesson that achieving that goal involves more than \nsimply handing people four walls, flooring and a roof and leaving them to fend \nfor themselves. \n\n\nCandidates for public housing are, by definition, people lacking some of the \nresources necessary to cope with the rough-and-tumble of the market system. And \nthis nearly always involves more than just rent money. \n\n\nApplicants for public housing, most often women on public assistance, usually \ncarry some baggage of woe, past or present -- teen-age pregnancy, domestic \nviolence and abuse, divorce and desertion, drug and alcohol addiction. The \ngrowing number of homeless families come from among these women. \n\n\nIn addition to roofs over their heads, families in public housing need day-care \nfacilities, job counseling, guidance in financial planning and assistance in \ntransportation. These are necessary adjuncts if such families are to stabilize \ntheir lives and eventually leave the welfare rolls. Both adults and children \nneed recreation programs. There need to be services or arrangements for \nexcluding gang violence, drug trafficking and other crimes. \n\n\nAt the bottom of the whole problem is a longstanding lack of coordination \nbetween the Department of Housing and Urban Development and federal welfare \nprograms. Public housing projects have been treated as a substitute for \nadequate welfare payments. The result has been a shortfall on both ends -- \ninadequate public housing and insufficient outlays to cover both shelter and \nthe support services necessary to get people off welfare. \n\n\nIn some communities across the country, public housing tenants, by remarkable \nbootstrap efforts, have brought about the needed social services. The National \nCouncil of Neighborhood Women in Brooklyn is an example of such effort. But \nself-help know-how is not universally on tap. In too many projects, the housing \nhas ended up as squalid, unlivable magnets of disorder and crime, suitable only \nfor tearing down. \n\n\nSocial workers assigned to public housing projects should not be seen as \nvigilantes on a mission of ferreting out anti-social elements. They should be \nthere to provide counseling and referrals to a range of health and mental \nhealth agencies, to help parents care for and educate their children \neffectively, to organize after-school activities for children and adolescents \nand to start support groups for young and old. Their presence among the most \n\"high-risk\" people in our city offers a singular opportunity for early \nintervention and possible prevention of destructive behavior. \n\n\nIf the social worker's role is seen as primarily guiding and assisting \nresidents in improving their lives and cultivating a constructive environment, \nthe Los Angeles plan can serve as a model for an important, much-needed advance \ntoward reversing the decline in low-income housing."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0011", "docId": "179413", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Metro; Part B; Page 7; Column 5; Op-Ed Desk", "length": "707", "headline": "POISED FOR GIDDY DEMOCRATIC HEIGHTS;", "byline": "By REIN TAAGEPERA, Rein Taagepera is a professor of social science at UC Irvine \nand a member of the general committee of the Citizens' Committees of the \nRepublic of Estonia.", "type": null, "graphic": "Drawing, KAL/ The Economist London", "text": "Among the many odd happenings in Eastern Europe, the nearing elections of the \nEstonian Congress rank with the strangest. Here's a country that Moscow still \nconsiders a part of the Soviet Union, yet its brash Citizens' Committees are \npreparing for non-Soviet elections Saturday. \n\n\nThese will be full-fledged general elections that bypass the entire Soviet \nadministrative structure and affirm the continued existence of the Republic of \nEstonia that Josef Stalin occupied and annexed 49 years ago. And Moscow, with \n150,000 troops stationed in Estonia, has let these open preparations proceed \nunhindered. The goal of the Estonian Congress will be to start talks with \nMoscow for withdrawal of Soviet occupation forces. \n\n\nThe Citizens' Committees were started a year ago by the Estonian Heritage \nSociety, the National Independence Party and the Christian Union. The parties \ninsisted that the committees be formed locally and not by emissaries from the \ncapital. One is reminded of the \"committees of correspondence\" that prepared \nthe ground for independence in the American colonies. \n\n\nThe Estonian committees spread their message person-to-person, circumventing an \ninformation blockade by the official Soviet media in Estonia. They weathered \ndoubts and criticism by the much better-organized but more cautiously reformist \nPopular Front. The ruling Communist Party of Estonia first tried silence, then \nblistering attacks, but both failed. In November, the local committees formed a \nnationwide general committee led by Tunne Kelam, ideological leader of the \nIndependence Party, with Heritage Society leader Trivimi Velliste as vice \nchairman. \n\n\nBy January the committees had registered more than half of the 1 million people \nwho qualify as citizens of the Republic of Estonia. There are also half a \nmillion post-occupation settlers, mainly Russians, who are illegal immigrants \nin the eyes of the Republic of Estonia. The Citizens' Committees are \nregistering them, too, but only as applicants for citizenship, eligible to \nelect non-voting delegates to the Estonian Congress. \n\n\nPrewar Russian residents of Estonia and their descendants qualify as citizens, \nwhile later immigrants do not, even if they are ethnically Estonian. Having \nleft Estonia as a child in 1944, I qualified. When visiting Estonia in August, \nI registered at a booth set up in front of what used to be my kindergarten. \n\n\nSetting up the practical machinery for nationwide elections is a demanding task \neven for a government. To do so while braving an administration in complete \ncommand of communication, transport and finances might look hopeless. Yet the \nstructure is now in place. About 1,200 candidates are running for 464 seats in \n110 multi-seat districts. Estonian exile organizations in the West will select \n35 more delegates. \n\n\nAs election plans took shape, the previously hesitant popular mood shifted \ndecisively, and the Popular Front jumped on the candidate bandwagon. The \nCommunist Party of Estonia is considering doing the same, and several Soviet \nEstonian government leaders are poised to jump. Soviet Estonia's head of state, \nArnold Ruutel, has declared that \"the Estonian Congress is a fact of political \nlife\" and represents a \"unique citizens' initiative reflecting the will of the \nEstonian people.\" \n\n\nElections for the Estonian Supreme Soviet are scheduled for March 18. This new \nSupreme Soviet may never come to be, once the Estonian Congress is in place, \nbut if it materializes, it will also be independence-minded. That leaves Moscow \nwith two options (apart from a disastrous military suppression): agree that the \nRepublic of Estonia is occupied territory from which Soviet troops should be \nwithdrawn, or face a declaration of secession by \"Soviet Estonia\" (which would \nset a precedent for all other Soviet republics). It will be in Moscow's \ninterest to deal with the Estonian Congress, blaming Stalin for the occupation \nand illegal annexation. \n\n\nThe groundwork for such an approach was laid when the Moscow Supreme Soviet \nvoided the Hitler-Stalin pact that, among other things, gave Estonia to Stalin. \nMikhail Gorbachev may even have already decided to let the Baltic states go, \nwhich would explain why he has not acted against Estonia's do-it-yourself \nelections."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0012", "docId": "179414", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Metro; Part B; Page 7; Column 1; Op-Ed Desk", "length": "736", "headline": "NO MATTER WHO WINS, AMERICA CAN HELP;", "byline": "By BOSCO MATAMOROS, Bosco Matamoros has been chief spokesman for the Contra \nmovement.", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, Opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro.

Neither the Sandinistas nor the United Nicaraguan \nOpposition (UNO) has exhibited the vision necessary to successfully resolve \nthese problems. \n\n\nNicaragua's economy has been reduced to subsistance levels. Exports have \ndropped to 20% of 1978 levels, unemployment has reached 30% of the working-age \npopulation and inflation is unmeasurable. These indicators are a formidable \nsource of political dissatisfaction. But the opposition's message has been lost \nin symbolism and it has not been able to to develop an appealing electoral \nplatform. Its campaign has suffered from divisions and a lack of leadership and \norganizational capacity. \n\n\nDuring the campaign, UNO has resembled the opposition in South Korea during its \nlast election, in which divisions in the opposition facilitated the victory of \nthe governing party. Persistent factionalism in the opposition is making it \nprobable that Ortega will be reconfirmed, but not because Nicaraguans are \nbetter off after 10 years of revolution or because Sandinism is the most \npopular movement. \n\n\nNevertheless, dissatisfaction and the search for an alternative have turned out \nlarge crowds for opposition rallies, united in the chant \"This time they go.\" \nThe spontaneous support of the people seems less the result of the appeal of \nUNO's campaign and electoral program than a referendum against Sandinista rule. \nIf economic issues and the urgency for change carry the election, Chamorro \ncould win. If nationalism and party organization are the key, Ortega benefits. \n\n\nOrtega's primary goal is to remain in power. The Sandinista's ideological \nproject has stalled, and the foreign subsidies that financed their \nrevolutionary experiments are no longer forthcoming. If he is defeated, \ninvalidating the election is not a realistic option. Such an act could easily \nengender a crisis similar to those that ended the regimes of Eastern Europe. \n\n\nBeginning the task of reconstruction will require a national accord. If UNO \nwins, its 14 constituent parties must form a coherent coalition without \ninterference from the United States. If the Sandinista front wins, it cannot \ncontinue to treat the opposition as a means of legitimizing its power or \npresume that it has been handed a mandate to continue promoting Sandinista \npolitical projects. \n\n\nMy country is exhausted by conflict, and international expectations awakened by \nthe revolution against Anastasio Somoza in 1979 have been frittered away. \nNicaragua needs political openness, a climate of confidence, management skills \nand foreign assistance. \n\n\nDuring the long campaign, the Bush Administration acts like an accountant, \nletting others take the risks while being content with recording profits and \nlosses. \n\n\nIts policy has been to hope for a UNO victory, which would be a cheap solution \nto the Nicaragua problem. Now, if the opposition does not win, what are the \nalternatives for U.S. policy? Continuation of the war is not a real \npossibility, despite the fact that several thousand resistance combatants are \ninside Nicaragua. No country in the region is willing to risk getting involved, \ngiven the unreliability of U.S. policy. And given the United States' new \nrelationship to the Soviet Union, there is simply no political will to re-start \nthe conflict. \n\n\nRegardless of who wins this election, the United States has the possibility of \nentering a new phase of relations with Nicaragua. Normalization is inevitable. \n\n\nU.S. policy must be clearly defined to avoid polarization of domestic debate \nand enhance the democratic process in Nicaragua. Resolving the trade embargo \nwould help economic recovery, and providing economic aid for the safe return \nand relocation of Nicaraguans would help national reconciliation. \n\n\nThe Bush Administration's foreign policy has been one of impeccable pragmatism. \nIn the case of Nicaragua, its reluctance to define its policy seems the result \nof internal political calculations. Until now, the silence of the \nAdministration has been justified for reasons of political prudence.

The organization invited a number of active \nenlisted personnel to attend. \n\n\nVice Adm. Jack Fetterman, commander of naval air forces in the Pacific and the \nranking naval officer in San Diego, and Adm. Leon Edney, vice chief of naval \noperations, headed a list of active and retired brass that also included Marine \nMajor Gen. John Mahoney, Marine Major Gen. Don Fulham and San Diego's \nastronaut-in-residence, retired Capt. Wally Schirra. \n\n\nRetired Rear Adm. Herbert Stoecklein, president of the local USO Council and \ngala co-chairman, said that \"Give Your Heart to the USO\" was the first of what \nthe organization intends to be an annual fund-raiser. Proceeds from the \ninaugural benefit, \n\n\nexpected to reach about $40,000, are earmarked for the $60,000 cost of opening \nand staffing the new USO facility at Lindbergh Field. \n\n\nThe event came a few days late to qualify for Valentine's Day status, and the \ndecor, which consisted of red and white carnation centerpieces and a few lacy \nhearts floating above the bandstand, was suitably restrained. In the immense \nand cavernous spaces offered by the convention center, most decor quickly \nbecomes lost anyway, although the giant red, white and blue USO banner, \nborrowed from the head office in Washington, made a powerful statement. \n\n\nSeveral guests who remembered some of the big, military-themed parties given \nduring World War II said that the mood somehow captured the brisk and \nefficiently hopeful tone of that era's entertainments. \n\n\nWhen the Dick Braun Orchestra played \"Anchors Aweigh\" the gala seemed almost a \nrevival of an earlier age in San Diego, and this impression was highlighted by \nthe party's location in the city's newest public building. But event organizers \nsaid they chose the center simply because it is a neighbor of the USO on Harbor \nDrive. \n\n\n\"After putting up with the years of construction it took to put up this \nbuilding, we had to come party here,\" said one USO staffer. \n\n\nServicemen make about 200,000 visits a year to the Harbor Drive USO, which in \naddition to offering a social setting provides such services as finding free \nhousing for families relocated by emergencies. \n\n\nThe military, perhaps because it likes a good parade, seems very fond of \ndancing, and most guests took the floor repeatedly between the several courses \nof a dinner that featured chilled shellfish remoulade, tournedos Bordelaise and \npastry swans. After the meal, the band briefly retired while KSDO radio \nannouncer Ron Reina conducted a live auction that contributed several thousand \ndollars to the event's proceeds; among the items were a \"Love Boat\" cruise to \nMexico and a pair of wooden duck decoys hand-carved by Rear Adm. Jack Adams. \n\n\nThe guest list included retired Rear Adm. Bruce Boland, Eleanor and Art \nHerzman, Morris Wax, Rachel and Judson Grosvenor, Sharon and Tim Considine, \nCathy and Nicholas Monroe, Fern and Robert Murphy, Carol and retired Vice Adm. \nHarry Schrader, Jan and Mike Madigan, Martha Carpenter, Jane Stoecklein, Betty \nand Cushman Dow, Shirley and retired Rear Adm. David Rubel, and Loretta \nBonvouloir. \n\n\nThe carefully plotted geometry of the annual Women of Dedication luncheon \nencompasses, within its generous angles, just about every charitable and social \nservice organization in the county, and was symbolized at Thursday's \"Silver \nJubilee\" luncheon at the San Diego Marriott by the silver boxes that centered \nevery table. \n\n\nThe day saw 15 women added to the roster of Women of Dedication, which in its \n25 years has developed into a reliable \"Who's Who\" of the county's volunteers. \nMore than 300 women now claim membership in this group. \n\n\nThe event ranks as the major annual fund-raiser given by the Women's Auxiliary \nto the Salvation Army Door of Hope and benefits maternity care, scholarship, \nand drug- and child-abuse prevention programs. But more than that, it has \nbecome a February tradition at which volunteers turn out to congratulate their \nown. As a result, a sold-out attendance of 940 jammed the ballroom Thursday, a \nturnout that Chairwoman Betty Hubbard described as \"thrilling and exciting.\" \n\n\n\"It's good to see women who have given so much to the community acknowledged,\" \nsaid Maj. Richard Love, county coordinator for the Salvation Army. \"The Women \nof Dedication deserve their name, because they do a spectacular job.\" \n\n\nThe Silver Jubilee proceeded according to the pattern established over the \nyears, with the lunch of dilled salmon and chocolate tulips preceding the \nformal march of the honorees. A fashion presentation by La Jolla's Capriccio \nconcluded the event. \n\n\nThe women walked in turn down the long runway while Channel 10 news anchor \nCarol LeBeau read each one's civic resume. These walks can be amusing when, as \nfrequently happens, the male escorts -- husbands, sons or family friends -- \nattempt to gallop down the ramp. A pre-event pep talk obviated that difficulty \nThursday. \n\n\nLetha H. Brown, president of the board of trustees of the San Diego Center for \nChildren, led the procession.

VINCE COMPAGNONE / Los Angeles Times", "text": "The greening of San Diego is about to pick up speed. \n\n\nFor too long in San Diego, landscaping has been an afterthought, if a thought \nat all. After Kate Sessions, the mother of San Diego horticulture, died in \n1940, no one stepped in to push for landscaping. \n\n\nArchitect Ed Malone once remarked, quite rightly, that landscaping has a \ngreater overall impact than architecture. When plants mature, they screen and \nsoften the impact of buildings. For pedestrians and motorists, plants modulate \nthe experience of moving along city sidewalks and streets. \n\n\nNow, through the efforts of city officials and concerned San Diegans, \nlandscaping is once again getting the attention it deserves. \n\n\nThe city is gearing up to better carry out a 1986 ordinance and an accompanying \nmanual spelling out how new projects must be landscaped. \n\n\nKelly Broughton was hired in December as principal landscape architect, \nreplacing Tom Story, a guiding force in drafting and implementing the \nordinance. (Story is now deputy director of city planning.) \n\n\nSoon, nine new landscape experts will be added to the current staff of five, \naugmenting Broughton's ability to see that landscaping on new commercial and \nmultifamily residential projects gets as much attention as architecture. \n\n\nIn 1986, San Diego created a position of principal landscape architect to \noversee the new landscape ordinance passed earlier that year. \n\n\nThe private sector is also lending a hand. \n\n\nOwners of single-family homes, which are not covered by the ordinance, are \nbeing enlightened by such private groups as People for Trees. Formed early last \nyear, the organization has already helped several neighborhoods plant trees \nalong streets. \n\n\nSessions, who for years operated a huge nursery at Sixth Avenue and Upas Street \non the edge of Balboa Park, was single-handedly responsible for many of the \ntrees (especially palms) that are such a large part of San Diego's character. \nShe was the city's first proponent of palms, planting hundreds and hundreds, \nincluding the Cocos plumosas along 6th venue, between Upas and Date streets, \nand at Horton Plaza park downtown. \n\n\nBut as San Diego rapidly grew in the '70s and '80s, and as city funds for \nlandscaping public rights-of-way dwindled, neighborhoods suffered. \n\n\nToday, some streets are lined with large old trees, which add a kind of \nfriendliness and warmth. \n\n\nFar more, however, are lined with concrete sidewalks, driveways and other cold, \nharsh elements. Entire neighborhoods, on the edge of Point Loma, for example, \nhave coaxed gravel or painted concrete front yards into an art form. \n\n\nOne trend that prompted the new law was the tendency for large, desolate \napartment complexes to replace small, single-family homes -- and their \naccompanying front gardens -- in many neighborhoods. \n\n\nAlready, according to Story, the ordinance has led to improvements. \n\n\n\"What was happening in the Mid-City area (including Normal Heights, Kensington \nand portions of East San Diego) was that homes were being bought up, leveled \nand replaced with a six- or eight-plex,\" Story said. \"They were filling the \nentire lot, except for the required setbacks, and putting all the parking right \nup front by the streets. Front yards became garages and concrete driveways for \ntwo- or three-story buildings. If there was enough density, they also put \nparking on the back sides of the buildings.\" \n\n\nUnder the landscaping ordinance, such \"street yards\" must now be 80% \nlandscaped, precluding the parking lot syndrome. Builders have had to tuck the \nrest of their parking behind or beneath buildings. \n\n\nThe ordinance also requires a minimum of landscaping in front of commercial \nbuildings. \n\n\nAlready, the ordinance and manual have improved new projects. \n\n\nOn Sports Arena Boulevard across from the Sports Arena in San Diego, a shopping \ncomplex changed owners two years ago and was remodeled, adding a new Home Depot \nstore and other businesses. \n\n\n\"When the Home Depot opened, existing landscaping was kept, but we had them add \na lot more trees,\" Story said. \"People have mentioned how good the quality of \nthe development is now.\" \n\n\nIn front of the mall, Sports Arena Boulevard is now lined with carrotwood \ntrees. Peppermint eucalyptus and evergreen pear trees break up the monotony of \nthe parking lots. Median strips are planted with such low water-use shrubs as \nIndia hawthorn and natal plum. Grass, known for its thirst, is used sparingly. \n\n\nBesides specifying both the quality and quantity of landscaping for a variety \nof projects, the ordinance details plant materials that conserve water and \nresist fire. One goal is to encourage the use of drought-tolerant ground covers \nin lieu of lawns. \n\n\nNative vegetation is to be retained where possible. Irrigation systems must \nmeet strict standards, including the use of moisture sensors to minimize water \nwaste. \n\n\nBut city rules alone won't make for a more beautiful San Diego, especially in \nolder residential neighborhoods, where new development governed by the \nordinance is minimal. \n\n\nKnowing this, and knowing that there's no city money available for landscaping \nthese streets, a group of San Diegans led by John and Ann Richards of Ocean \nBeach has banded together, calling itself People for Trees. \n\n\nStory has been a member from the beginning. The organization tries to join \nneedy neighborhoods with corporate donors, with advice on tree selection \navailable through the city's Planning and Park and Recreation departments. \n\n\nPeople for Trees coordinated the planting last spring of 50 fern pines on \nWaring Road, just north of Interstate 8 near Mission Valley, where several \nlarge ash trees had been removed after their roots began to destroy sidewalks. \nThe trees were donated by Kaiser Permanente. \n\n\nAll told, People for Trees has supervised the planting of 2,000 trees along \nstreets, and at schools and other public places. This year, the organization \nwill plant at least 1,400 more trees, with the help of a $42,000 state grant \nfor street trees awarded last fall. \n\n\nIn Southeast San Diego, Project First Class, started five years ago by \nthen-City Councilman William Jones, is aimed at neighborhood improvements, \nincluding the installation of street trees purchased with federal money \nchanneled through the city of San Diego. So far, 65 trees have been planted in \nand around Memorial Park, and five at Martin Luther King Jr. Park. \n\n\nThe city is encouraging these efforts. \n\n\n\"Led by People for Trees, the city is adopting a citywide tree-planting goal \nand policy statement,\" Broughton said. \n\n\nWith state Arbor Day coming March 7, and national Arbor Day on April 28, it's a \ngood time to think about trees.

A group of \nmothers, top right, discusses the program at the school.", "text": "They are small problems now, the kinds that often get chalked up to being \"just \na stage.\" \n\n\nBut to an increasing number of counselors, teachers and psychologists, some \ncommon behavioral characteristics in kindergarten-age children -- including \naggression, tearfulness or reluctance to play with other children -- can be \nwarning signals of problems to come. \n\n\nMany recent studies have looked at reasons children drop out of school, \"and \none of the things they found is that a lot of problems could be traced back to \nkindergarten,\" said Alison McAlpine, director of the Los Angeles Unified School \nDistrict's Kindergarten Intervention Program (KIP). \n\n\n\"The thinking until now has been that kids would eventually outgrow certain \nadjustment difficulties,\" McAlpine said. \"Now we're seeing that it isn't \nnecessarily so.\" \n\n\nEight years ago KIP was begun in a handful of elementary schools to reach out \nto children identified by teachers as needing special attention, but who have \nnot yet reached a point where counseling has become necessary. Under the \nprogram, volunteers with the district's school mental health office go into \nclassrooms and work with at-risk students in small groups or one-on-one. The \ngoal, McAlpine said, has been to help children with adjustment problems feel \ngood about themselves, and thus their ability to succeed in school. \n\n\n\"When you have 33 children in your class, even if you gave 120% of yourself, it \nstill wouldn't be enough to reach the children who need that extra bit of \nattention,\" said Tobi Rosen, a kindergarten teacher at Erwin Street School in \nVan Nuys for the last 20 years who was one of the first teachers in the San \nFernando Valley to implement the program. \"The children get that extra bit of \nconfidence from the volunteers, and the feeling that someone really cares.\" \n\n\nAlthough only a few schools took advantage of the program a few years ago, \nMcAlpine said, 44 elementary schools in the Valley now have volunteers who work \nin kindergarten classrooms. Since receiving a federal grant two years ago, \nMcAlpine said, the KIP program, which is affiliated with a similar program at \nUCLA, is being expanded into first-grade classrooms. \n\n\n\"We've been able to follow some of the kids into about fifth grade, and there \nhave been good results,\" she said, adding that UCLA is doing follow-up studies \nto determine the program's effectiveness. \"Although it's difficult to say now \nwhat would have happened if there had been no intervention, many of those \nchildren who are identified as being at-risk in kindergarten are doing well.\" \n\n\nKIP, which McAlpine said was modeled after a similar program in New York, has \nbeen praised by psychologists. Florence Bienenfeld, a former kindergarten and \neducational consultant in Pacific Palisades who holds a doctorate in marriage \nand family counseling, said, \"It's so good to see that schools are willing to \nput money into a preventive program like this, instead of into a mop-up program \nfor dropouts after the fact. Prevention really is the key for these kids.\" \n\n\nThe program, however, actually costs schools nothing and is an inexpensive \nsolution for the district, McAlpine said, since it relies solely on trained \nvolunteers. Many college students and senior citizens are KIP volunteers. \n\n\n\"We had one senior citizen volunteer who was in a wheelchair,\" Rosen said. \"He \nloved the children, but they also really loved him.\" \n\n\nChildren, though, aren't the only ones who receive assistance from the program. \nParenting workshops, which are held two times at the onset at each elementary \nschool involved with the program, give parents the chance to talk about \nproblems they are encountering, as well as to receive advice from the school \nmental health staff. Interpreters are provided for Spanish-speaking parents. \n\n\nAt El Oro Way Elementary School in Granada Hills, 16 mothers recently pulled \ntheir chairs into a circle in the school's auditorium to talk about what many \ndescribe as daily battles with their kids. Topics range from aggressive \nbehavior and sibling rivalry, to getting children into bed at night or up in \nthe morning. \n\n\nFor most parents, the mere mention of aggression hit a nerve. Each had a story \nto tell about angry or hostile behavior and how they had dealt with it. \n\n\nSusan Moreno, the mother of four children and also an assistant third-grade \nteacher, told the group that she was hospitalized two years ago for several \ndays after undergoing emergency surgery. Frightened and unable to understand \nwhy his mother had left so suddenly, Moreno's son, now 6, began taking out his \nfeelings of anger on his baby sister. \n\n\n\"He was blaming the baby for my health problems,\" Moreno said. \"I kept telling \nhim I didn't like the behavior with his sister and that I wouldn't tolerate it, \nbut it wasn't working.\" \n\n\nShe began to see a positive effect, Moreno told the group, after she set aside \na specific amount of \"special time\" each day with her son. During the 10 or 15 \nminutes they spent together after dinner, she said, \"He knew that he didn't \nneed to compete at all for my attention and that it was our time together. It \ntook him two years, but I think he knows now that I'm not going away.\" \n\n\nOther members of the group shared similar experiences with aggressive behavior \nin their children, as well as the benefits of giving children -- especially \nones with siblings -- individualized attention each day. \n\n\nMcAlpine, who lead the group along with two other staff members from KIP, \npointed out another positive aspect. \n\n\n\"As every mother knows, there are some times when you simply are too busy to \nstop everything and give your full attention to what a child is saying,\" she \nsaid. \"Instead of saying, 'Not now,' though, you can say, 'I want to hear this, \nbut I'm very busy right now. Can you hang onto it and share it with me at our \nspecial time?' \" \n\n\nBut, as most parents at the meeting attested, competition with siblings isn't \nthe only source of aggression with young children. Several parents voiced their \nconcerns over the effects of too much television and the difficulties they \nencountered when they attempted to control what shows their children watched. \n\n\n\"My son has been punching a lot, and so he's no longer allowed to watch \n'America's Most Wanted' or other violent shows,\" one mother said. \"I don't know \nwhether that will help, though.\" \n\n\nIn typical support-group fashion, several mothers offered other suggestions for \nhelping the boy deal with pent-up anger or frustration. \n\n\n\"Maybe you should try putting a punching bag in the garage,\" said another \nmother. \"Let him get it all out.\" \n\n\nTerry Fischette, on-site coordinator with KIP, said she gave her son karate \nlessons when he began acting aggressively. Instead of becoming more violent, \nshe said, the aggression actually stopped. \"I asked him why he stopped, and he \nsaid, 'Because now I know I don't have to fight. I know that I could.' It \nhelped him channel energy.\" \n\n\nThe parenting workshops, though, are meant to be more than just an emotional \nswap meet. With the help of school mental health professionals who interject \nadvice frequently during the sessions, parents learn about the developmental \ncharacteristics of children and ways to promote positive social adjustments. \n\n\nMcAlpine and other staff members encourage parents to use behavior modification \ntechniques with their children, instead of putting themselves in what they say \noften amounts to exhausting, repetitive power struggles. \n\n\n\"Sometimes we get stuck by thinking, 'By God, I'm going to hang in there and \nkeep punishing him when the undesirable behavior comes up,' \" McAlpine said to \nthe mothers, when the issue of consistency arose. \"If something isn't working, \ntry something else,\" she advised. \n\n\nOne of the best ways to change unwanted behavior with young children is with a \ntechnique called charting, according to Bobbie Ozar, a kindergarten consultant \nwith KIP who attended the meeting. Parents sit down with a child and define in \nclear terms what behavior they want to eliminate -- whether it is \"yelling\" or \n\"hitting your brother.\" They then tell the child that, for each day the \nbehavior stops, the child will receive a star on a chart. \n\n\nAt the end of one or two weeks -- any longer, Ozar said, and the child loses \ninterest -- a reward is given to the child. \n\n\n\"Does that work with getting a kid to wake up in the morning?\" one parent \nasked, eliciting immediate groans of familiarity from the group. \"No matter \nwhat I do, it's always, 'Five more minutes.' \" \n\n\nMoreno said she had success trying a somewhat more creative approach than \nnagging. At the suggestion of a friend, Moreno said she went about her morning \nroutine after her son insisted on \"just another few minutes\" in bed. When he \nfinally woke up and realized how late he was for school, Moreno said she told \nhim to keep his pajamas on all day and stay in bed. \n\n\n\"That was the last time he did it,\" she said. \"Now when I say to get up, he's \nup.\" \n\n\nMcAlpine said she applauds such creative approaches. She recalled one mother at \nanother group who hadn't been able to stop her young children from fighting in \nfront of the television. After two warnings the mother sent her children into \ntheir rooms and then proceeded to sit on the couch and watch cartoons with the \nvolume turned up high. \n\n\n\"She sat there and laughed and laughed for them to hear her, just as though she \nwas having the greatest time,\" McAlpine said. \"Instead of just being sent to \ntheir rooms, they realized what they were missing out on because of their \nfighting. \n\n\n\"It's that kind of approach that can do wonders to change behavior,\" she said. \n\"Parents just need to learn that they have more tools available to them than \nthey may know.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0020", "docId": "179434", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition", "section": "View; Part E; Page 7A; Column 4", "length": "222", "headline": "CAPPING AN ERA;", "byline": "By MICHAEL ARKUSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "Tomorrow, the last 670,000 bottles of beer will pass rapidly through the \nassembly line.

They have no \none's best interests at heart except their own.\" \n\n\n\"They've just come in here and thrown salt in our wounds,\" said Norm Manzer, \nhead of a group trying to legally derail the Wine Train. \"To threaten someone \nwith the type of project like they have is bad enough, but then they did it \nwithout so much as talking with us. From day one it was full steam ahead, \n'catch us if you can.' \" \n\n\n\n\nManzer, a State Farm Insurance agent whose office is \"within spitting distance\" \nof the train tracks in St. Helena, and many others are sure they can catch the \ntrain and stop it dead in its tracks. They feel an Environmental Impact Report \nwill show that the train would destroy the way of life in the Napa Valley. \n\n\nThe Wine Train started Sept. 16 on a temporary schedule, running the 21 miles \nfrom the city of Napa to St. Helena, in the heart of the valley, then back \nagain. The original idea was to permit visitors to see the vines and wineries \nwithout clogging the roads with cars. Visitors would be able to disembark en \nroute to visit wineries. \n\n\nThe idea of an idyllic, turn-of-the-century excursion immediately met \nresistence from residents in a rare show of unity. It's been said that no two \nwine makers can ever agree on so much as the time of day, so the Wine Train is \nbeing seen as unique: the first subject on which almost everyone agrees. \n\n\nProtesting the smoke from the 1954 Diesel engines, the clatter of the steel \nwheels on rails, the whine of the engine's mournful horns, the danger at dozens \nof track crossings, the cost to taxpayers and other irritants, locals rebelled. \n\n\nThe winery executive said matters were exacerbated when Wine Train officials \n\"never talked to us. They just decided to ram this down our throats, whether we \nliked it or not.\" He said Wine Train officials have been arrogant and distant. \n\n\n\"If anyone ever wanted to write a book on how to do bad community relations, \nthese guys already wrote the book,\" said one winery owner, who asked for \nanonymity because he didn't want to create animosity with neighbors. \n\n\nJohn C. (Jack) McCormack, president and chief executive of the Wine Train, \nacknowledges the opposition by groups such as Manzer's Friends of the Napa \nValley, which was formed expressly to oppose him. He says the company's timing \nwas simply wrong. \n\n\n\"Some of the wineries took opposition to the Wine Train to take the heat off \nthe winery definition question,\" said McCormack, noting that when the Wine \nTrain project began in 1985, the winery definition issue was just heating up. \n\"If we had started a couple of years earlier . . . ,\" said McCormack, implying \nthat the train would have been widely accepted. \n\n\n\"Even now you don't find as much opposition (to the train) when you talk to \nwine makers individually as when you talk to them as a group,\" he said. \n\n\nThere is no guarantee the Wine Train will ever run a full schedule, and faces \nthe possibility its present limited schedule will also be terminated. Local and \nstate groups are challenging Wine Train's existence in both the State Supreme \nCourt and in a federal court in Washington. \n\n\nIn a case already extremely complex, the State Supreme Court is to rule soon \nover whether the state has the authority to require an environmental review of \nthe train. And the Interstate Commerce Commission is reconsidering its original \nruling that it has jurisdiction over the train. \n\n\nOne of the key issues is whether the train must submit to the California \nEnvironmental Quality Act. Wine Train officials say that if Southern Pacific, \nwhich owned the right-of-way before 1987, had wanted to expand service here, it \nwould have been able to do so without scrutiny of an EIR. \n\n\nEarly last year, the ICC ruled that it had jurisdiction over the Wine Train. \nThis would have given Wine Train the right to operate without restrictions from \nthe California Public Utilities Commission. Under ICC jurisdiction, trains are \nsubject to virtually no controls, operating under regulations established in \nthe past century. \n\n\nAmong the rules that Wine Train officials relish is the one that would not \nrequire the filing of an EIR. \n\n\nFriends of Napa Valley and the PUC appealed the ICC ruling to the U.S. District \nCourt of Appeals in Washington. Before that appeal could be heard, the court \nlast summer ruled in a case involving a small rail spur in Illinois. The court \nreversed the ICC decision and gave jurisdiction over the spur to the Illinois \nCommerce Commission. \n\n\nThe ICC then requested that it be allowed to review its decision in the Wine \nTrain case, leading to speculation it will reverse itself. \n\n\nEvelyn Kitay, an attorney with the office of the general counsel of the ICC, \nsaid the Illinois case is unrelated to the Napa case, but \"we issued an order \nto reopen the Napa decision in light of the Illinois case,\" she said, adding \nthat there \"might be a reversal\" of ICC's earlier decision. Or ICC could rule \nthe same way based on new grounds. \n\n\nA critical question for the Wine Train, Kitay said, is: \"Is there a nexus to \ninterstate commerce?\" If not, federal control may not be warranted, she \nindicated. \n\n\nMcCormack argues that Wine Train is a carrier of goods in interstate commerce \nas well as a feeder line for Amtrak passenger service, and thus it should be \nruled by ICC -- which would free it from having to file the EIR. \n\n\nOpponents fire back that there is no rail service from the Wine Train terminus \nto the nearest Amtrak station at Martinez, some 20 miles south; passengers must \ntake a bus between the lines. And that there hasn't been a passenger train in \nthe Napa Valley since the 1920s. \n\n\nManzer's group feels that the EIR will show that the train would make a \nnegative impact on the valley. \"If ICC gives jurisdiction back to the PUC, we \nwill kill the train,\" said Manzer. \"We know that the things that will be found \nin the EIR will be unmitigateable.\" \n\n\nBecause of the crucial nature of the EIR, a group was formed 18 months ago at \nthe suggestion of the St. Helena City Council called ALERT -- Alliance for the \nEnvironmental Report on the Train. ALERT includes the city of St. Helena, the \ntown of Yountville, Napa County and five local trade groups -- Napa County Farm \nBureau, Napa County Grape Growers Assn., Napa Valley Vintners Assn., United \nNapa Valley Associates and Friends of the Napa Valley. \n\n\nALERT attorney Michael Riback said the thrust of the ALERT argument is simply \nthat Wine Train is not a means of transportation as much as it is a tourist \nline. \n\n\n\"In the eyes of ALERT, the Wine Train is not a transportation or commuter \noperation,\" said Riback, \"it is a tourist operation akin to the monorail at \nDisneyland, where you're taking the ride for the ride's sake, not to get to a \nparticular destination.\" \n\n\nManzer calls the Wine Train \"nothing more than a bar and restaurant on wheels, \nplowing its way through the agricultural preserve of the Napa Valley.\" And he \npointed out that in the local Yellow Pages, Wine Train is listed under \n\"restaurants.\" \n\n\nThe EIR, which is being done for Wine Train by a San Mateo company, is due by \nAugust. \n\n\nIn the meantime, a series of public meetings has been scheduled to hear \nquestions about Wine Train's impact on residents, municipalities, businesses, \nthe tax structure and the agriculture of the region. \n\n\nAt a meeting last Thursday night at the Yountville Town Hall, about 40 persons \nshowed up to hear Earth Metrics, a San Mateo company doing the environmental \nreport on the train, discuss its Proponent's Environmental Assessment. \n\n\nThen representatives from Napa County, the town of Yountville and the city of \nSt. Helena all made inquiries of Earth Metrics, asking the company to address \nconcerns not mentioned in the PEA report. Further meetings were scheduled. \n\n\nOne of the key problems as far as Manzer and others are concerned is the cost \nof the train to taxpayers. Friends of the Valley says taxpayers will foot a $6 \nmillion bill to pay for improvements to the line, including gate crossings and \na rerouting of traffic along State Highway 29 at Trancas Street in Napa, a \nparticularly knotty intersection at the north end of Napa. \n\n\nMcCormack, aware of all the arguments against his train, says his organization \nwill make every effort to keep the valley exactly as it is. \n\n\n\"It is not in our best interests to see the valley turn into a bedroom \ncommunity of San Francisco,\" he says. \"We have as much of a stake in keeping \nthe region agrarian as they do.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0022", "docId": "179442", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Food; Part H; Page 2; Column 1", "length": "1927", "headline": "SWEETS, CHOCOLATE AND CALIFORNIANS DOMINATE 34TH PILLSBURY BAKE-OFF;", "byline": "By BETSY BALSLEY, Balsley is the former Times' Food editor.", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, Linda Rahman of Petaluma, Calif., won the $40,000 grand prize for \nBlueberry-Poppy Seed Brunch Cake. ; Photo, Fudge Crostata With Raspberry Sauce \nwon a $10,000 prize for Paula Cassidy of Berkeley, Calif. ; Photo, Nancy \nWoodside of Sonora, Calif., also won $10,000 for her Chocolate Fudge Snack Cake \nrecipe.", "text": "They loved Willard.

But Paul Walsh, chief operating officer of Pillsbury, Inc., \nspeaking at a seminar preceding the Bake-Off, quickly put them to rest. \n\n\nPillsbury has no plans to drop the popular cooking contest so long as there is \ninterest in it on the part of consumers, he assured his questioners. In fact, \nplans are already well under way to hold the next of the biannual events at \nDisney World in Orlando, Fla., in 1992. The first Bake-Off was held in 1949 in \nNew York City. It was held annually in various cities around the country until \n1976 when it became a biannual event. \n\n\nThe appeal of the Bake-Off is legendary, largely because the value of the cash \nand other prizes is sizable. Cash prizes amount to $126,000, including a grand \nprize of $40,000, five $10,000 prizes and 18 $2,000 prizes. In addition, \nPillsbury's co-sponsor, Sears, provides the grand prize winner with a $10,000 \nkitchen make-over. They also give the $10,000 winners a choice of a Sears \nKenmore gas or electric range, and the $2,000 prize winners receive Kenmore \nfood processors. Each finalist also receives a free trip to the Bake-Off site \nto compete in the finals. \n\n\nBecause of the lure of the Bake-Off prizes, many finalists are repeat \ncontestants, entering the contest year after year. This year was no exception. \nOf the 99 cooks who made it to this year's finals, (one California contestant \nhad to drop out at the last minute) six were back for the third time and 16 \nwere competing for the second time. Fourteen Californians, several of whom were \nrepeaters, competed this year. \n\n\nThe 34th Bake-Off offered entrants a greatly expanded list of products that \ncould be used in the recipes they entered. Besides the usual Pillsbury brand \nproducts such as flour, cake mixes, biscuits, rolls and pie and pizza dough, \ncontestants could also use Pillsbury's Green Giant brand canned and frozen \nvegetables. \n\n\nAs food trends and cooking techniques change throughout the years, so do the \nentries in the Bake-Off. This year was no exception. Contestants entered \nrecipes classed as ethnic specialties, quick meals, indulgent treats or \nhealthful alternatives in any of six basic categories based on Pillsbury \nproducts. \n\n\nSouthwestern and Mexican flavorings and ingredients were popular with both \nthose who made it to the finals and those who didn't. Low fat, high fiber foods \nappeared often, however, the healthful trend took a back seat to good flavor in \nmany cases, particularly in the indulgent treat category. Chocolate remains the \nnumber one flavor in sweets and liquor and liquers were much in evidence as \ningredients in the dessert entries. \n\n\nThe inclusion of canned and frozen vegetables as products acceptable for use \nunder contest rules brought about a wide array of soup, pizza and casserole \nentries. Spinach was by far the favorite vegetable of the finalists and many \ncommented that their recipes helped them persuade their children to eat the \n\"dreaded green.\" \n\n\nOne major change in the way we eat was noted by Pillsbury. At the first \nBake-Off, only nine spices and herbs were called for by the finalists. Monday's \ncompetition sent company shoppers on the search for 34 different flavorings. \nAnd if there is any doubt that pizzas are popular, walking up and down the \naisles among the ranges in use during the Bake-Off, one found that seven \ncompetitors were preparing everything from chicken fajita pizza to a hearty \nReuben pizza. \n\n\nFlour is still the most popular ingredient in the Bake-Off although Pillsbury \nhome economists noted that in numerous entries baking mixes are being used the \nway flour was 20 years ago. Chocolate cake mix and brownie mix are becoming \n\"chocolate flour\" in recipes that often call for additional chocolate as well. \nIt took 23 different kinds of chocolate to fill the needs of the finalists. \n\n\nNuts also were popular ingredients in this year's finals.

TOM VAN DYKE", "text": "The gorgeously outfitted interiors, calming music and black-tie service aboard \nthe dining car of the Napa Valley Wine Train give no clue to the hurricane of \ncontroversy swirling outside over its very existence. \n\n\nOutside of its controversial image among locals, the Wine Train has already \nsucceeded in terms of ambience. Travelers step into a time gone by, an idyllic \nsetting of elegance and style, good manners and taste. \n\n\nIn the leisurely excursion from the city of Napa north to St. Helena and back \nagain, travelers are treated to well-prepared food, fine service, elegant \ndinnerware and luxurious furniture. \n\n\nAs a dining experience, the train is unique. Meals are creatively conceived by \nchef Ken Schloss, a protege of Jeremiah Tower of San Francisco. Menus include \ncannelloni in buckwheat crepes, duck terrine, Norwegian salmon, filet mignon \nand espresso flan for dessert. \n\n\nA wide selection of wines from top Napa Valley wineries are offered, by the \nglass or bottle, at reasonable prices. \n\n\nThe trappings include china, silver and crystal glassware atop white \ntablecloths. A warm towel is presented as you sit down, to refresh the face \nbefore dining. \n\n\nThe 1915-era cars, refurbished with new interiors, include mahogany woodwork, \nbrightly colored fabric on newly designed chairs and couches, velvet draperies, \nwool beige carpeting, brass fixtures, oval glass partitions etched with grapes \nand marble countertops in the restrooms. The colors are cream, green and \nBurgundy. \n\n\nThere are even small heaters at foot level for cold days. \n\n\nAfter meals are completed, dessert is served in the lounge car as diners sit in \nplush, oversized swivel chairs or at tables for four. \n\n\nStill, there are drawbacks, including the fact that you go nowhere. You start \nand end in the same place, and until a legal squabble over the train is \nsettled, that's not going to change. \n\n\nAlso, some passengers never see the sights of the Napa Valley. During late fall \nand winter, the dinner train runs in darkness, after the sun has set. \n\n\nMoreover, passengers float past some of the most famous vineyards in the world, \nbut have no clue as to which is what. They sail past the famed Napanook \nVineyard that produces Dominus, past the road leading to Martha's Vineyard, \npast the vineyard that produces the BV Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, and \nthere's no one to tell what's here. \n\n\nIn addition, although this attraction should appeal to wine collectors, Wine \nTrain prohibits patrons from bringing a bottle of wine on board and consuming \nit -- not even for a corkage charge. That means that if you buy an older \nvintage of a great Napa Valley wine at one of the tasting rooms, you'll have to \nsip it elsewhere. \n\n\nAnd if a party of five or more wants to enjoy the train together, they'll have \nto dine at separate tables. The maximum number that can fit at a table is four. \n\n\nNapa Valley Wine Train Inc. was formed in 1984 as a limited partnership of \nseven investors. Today the company has 13 shareholders headed by Vincent \nDeDominico, former chairman of Golden Grain Macaroni Products, the Rice-a-Roni \nfolks. Jack McCormack was hired as president and chief operating officer. \n\n\nThe partnership bought the right-of-way on the 21 1/4-mile line from Southern \nPacific Railroad in April of 1987. Included in the deal was about 125 acres of \nland, including a parking area in downtown St. Helena. \n\n\nSince then, the company says, it has spent $14 million on acquiring and \nrefurbishing 20 Pullman coaches used to haul passengers, including installation \nof a modern kitchen and serving facilities. \n\n\nThe Wine Train depot in north Napa has two gift shops, one of which carries \nwine and, ironically, aprons and T-shirts -- items that were among the disputes \nin the winery definition controversy that erupted passions throughout the \nvalley in the last three years. \n\n\nThe Wine Train now runs three times a day on a Preliminary Limited Service \nagreement with local groups that prohibits passengers from getting on or off \nthe train except at the depot. And all riders on most runs now must purchase \nlunch or dinner tickets, making the round trip a $45 to $57.50 excursion. \n\n\nIf Wine Train is permitted to run six round-trip trains per day, as McCormack's \nwall chart shows, the company would also run shuttle buses to various wineries \nfrom stops at Yountville, Rutherford, and St. Helena. Buses also would run as \nfar east as the Silverado Trail. The train's current lunch/dinner requirement \nwould be waived. \n\n\n\"We could operate and make money on our present (temporary) schedule,\" said \nMcCormack. \"We can make a profit, though not as much. We're booked through \nApril right now.\" \n\n\nThe train winds north through the north end of Napa with vistas as grand and \nglorious as laundry on a line in a back yard, garbage bins and an industrial \npark's parking lot. \n\n\nThe train crosses to the west of State Highway 29 at Trancas Street, then \nslowly chugs north past Newlan, Trefethen and Lakespring wineries before it \ngets to Yountville, where Domaine Chandon is located. \n\n\nThe train continues north through Oakville, past the entrance to the Robert \nMondavi Winery, and continues past Beaulieu and Inglenook in Rutherford. Just \nafter it passes Franciscan, it crosses the highway once again, moving to the \neast of Highway 29. \n\n\nA few hundred yards before it enters downtown St. Helena, the train passes a \nhuge sign atop a truck. The sign has the international red-circle symbol and \nthe words \"Wine Train\" with a red slash through it. The complete round trip \ntakes about 2 1/2 hours. \n\n\nIf full service is ever approved, Wine Train personnel say, the plan is to \nextend the tracks north of St. Helena, possibly wind up eventually in \nCalistoga. \n\n\nFew wineries in the valley support the Wine Train, but opponents say only four \nwineries publicly support the train -- Sunny St. Helena, Grgich Hills, DeMoor \nand Sequoia Grove. All four have taken ads out in the Wine Train's newspaper, \nthe Napa Valley Traveler. \n\n\nWine maker Mike Grgich, an acknowledged supporter of the train, said he felt \nthe possibility of freight and commuter service would make the train valuable \nto the valley. \n\n\n\"I came from Europe, where the train was very friendly,\" said Grgich, a native \nof Croatia. \"We used the train all the time, it was an alternative to \nautomobiles. I'm used to the train.\" \n\n\nGrgich said the train could be used for shipping wine, \"instead of those trucks \ncoming up and down the road; if we shipped by railroad, those trucks would be \neliminated. And I believe Wine Train should establish commuter service, which \nwould be very helpful to the traffic on the highway.\" (McCormack says commuter \nservice is under consideration.) \n\n\nHowever, some wine makers are irritated at having their names connected to the \ntrain. \n\n\nA Wine Train waiter, asked which wine makers had ridden the train, said Bob \nMondavi and Jack Cakebread both have taken the trip and were supporters. \nHowever, both men, contacted at their wineries, denied they supported the train \nand were bothered that their names were mentioned in that context. \n\n\nOpponents have been vocal. Dick Grace, who makes one of the most prestigious \nCabernets in the Napa Valley, said, \"The wine train could conceivably be the \nmost damaging contributor toward the demise of the Napa Valley's life style as \nwell as the quality of its most important product, world class wines.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0025", "docId": "179451", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Westside; Part J; Page 1; Column 2", "length": "725", "headline": "FOOD PROJECT'S FUNDING TO GO FOR VOUCHERS;", "byline": "By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "The Greater West Hollywood Food Coalition, the group that for two years has fed \nscores of homeless people in Plummer Park, received another setback this week \nwhen the City Council voted to accept a task force recommendation to transfer \nfunds from the coalition to a food voucher program. \n\n\nThe council's decision, which came after midnight at Tuesday's meeting, means \nthat the coalition will no longer receive an annual payment of $30,000 from the \ncity. It is one of several setbacks the group has experienced recently. \n\n\nEarlier this month the city ordered the coalition to leave Plummer Park by \nMarch 6 after neighborhood complaints that the nightly feeding program was \nattracting crime and creating sanitation problems. \n\n\nAnd last week, a major food source of the coalition's dried up when Drexel \nBurnham Lambert closed its doors for good. The leftovers from Drexel's \nlunchtime meals for its employees made up the bulk of the food that the \ncoalition fed the up to 150 homeless people each night at Plummer Park. \n\n\n\"This is not a good time,\" said Mike Dean, the coalition's president. \"But we \nare not going to let this get us down; we are going to continue to do the best \nwe can to feed the homeless.\" \n\n\nThe City Council's 5-0 decision sets up a voucher system that will provide \nmeals in fast-food restaurants, as suggested by a 17-member task force composed \nof residents around Plummer Park, advocates for the homeless and members of the \nfood coalition. \n\n\nUnder the program, the Gay and Lesbian Community Service Center will receive a \nsix-month allotment of $15,000, enough money to give roughly 23 people a day a \n$3.50 meal at a local fast-food restaurant. Vouchers will be issued only to \npeople who are already taking part in another social service program. \n\n\n\"We can't feed every homeless person in the county,\" City Councilman Paul \nKoretz said. \"The (coalition's) program hasn't worked for the city of West \nHollywood. There were too many hustlers and drug addicts who were maintaining \ntheir habits on free meals. They were not being encouraged to change their \nsituations.\" \n\n\nBesides, Koretz added, the city does more than most communities in combatting \nhomelessness. Every night, the West Hollywood Park Auditorium becomes a shelter \nfor about two dozen homeless people. \n\n\nDespite the council's vote in favor of the voucher system, several council \nmembers expressed concern that the program may leave many people hungry. \nAnother question expressed was about the willingness of restaurants to \nparticipate in the program. \n\n\nCouncilman John Heilman said he wondered whether giving the contract to the gay \nand lesbian center would give the wrong impression that only gays and lesbians \nwere being served. The council agreed to reevaluate the program after six \nmonths. \n\n\nThe city's action against the coalition's feeding program came after residents \ncomplained that they were afraid to use the park because it had become a \nhangout for criminals. The program was shut down briefly last fall, but the \ncoalition mounted a successful campaign, led by celebrities and advocates for \nthe homeless, to keep it open. \n\n\n\"The program has generated more support from stars and junk bond kings than it \nhas from the community,\" said Tad Bright, co-chairman of the Eastend Community \nAction Committee. \"The park should be for everybody, but people are afraid to \ngo there. Needles have been found in the sandbox. Seniors lock their doors at \nnight and are afraid to come out.\" \n\n\nCommunity residents and city officials had asked the coalition to screen those \nwho are served in its food lines, but the group refused. \n\n\n\"There is no way to screen people. Our philosophy has always been to feed all \nthose in the line,\" said Ted Landreth, a spokesman for the coalition. \n\n\nLandreth said the group plans to temporarily relocate its feeding operation to \na closed restaurant owned by hotelier Severyn Ashkenazy after the March 6 \nevacuation deadline. Residents in the neighborhoods surrounding the London Club \nrestaurant at Beverly Place and La Cienega Boulevard have vowed to fight that \nmove. \n\n\nEventually, Landreth said, the group plans to raise $111,000 to operate a \nmobile food van that would distribute food to the poor at several locations \nthroughout the city. \n\n\n\"The problem is that everyone want to help the homeless, but no one wants them \nnear their house,\" Landreth said."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0026", "docId": "179452", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Ventura County; Part J; Page 1; Column 2", "length": "1987", "headline": "PAINTING 2 PICTURES OF GANG THREAT;", "byline": "By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, The graffiti on a building at Cooper Street and Bonita Avenue in Oxnard \nare one sign of gang activity in the city. LAWRENCE K. HO / Los Angeles Times; \nPhoto, Oxnard Police Chief Robert Owens says gang problems are exaggerated.", "text": "After a group of Oxnard teen-agers drove to Ventura's Buenaventura Mall and \nfired shots at Ventura gang members last May, county prosecutors identified one \nof the gunmen as a member of a Filipino gang in Oxnard called the Kanto Gang \nBoys, also known as the KGB. \n\n\nIn November, Oxnard gang members allegedly struck again, opening fire with a \nshotgun and wounding five people outside a Round Table Pizza restaurant in \nMoorpark, where about 40 teen-agers had gathered after a football game. \n\n\nVentura County prosecutors say the Oxnard youth suspected of driving the car in \nthat shooting wore a black baseball cap with the letters RSGC, signifying \nmembership in the predominantly black and Latino Oxnard gang called the Rolling \nSixties Gangster Crips. \n\n\nThe violence took a fatal turn Nov. 22 in Oxnard when Manuel Rodriguez, a \nmember of a Latino gang called the Lemonwood Chiques, was shot in the head and \nleft to die in front of Channel Islands High School. \n\n\nWitnesses said the shooting occurred after Rodriguez yelled gang slogans at \nArnel Salagubang, 19, a member of a Filipino gang called the Santanas or STS \nwho has been charged with the shooting. \n\n\nTo some Ventura County officials, the pattern of violence suggests that Oxnard \nhas a growing gang problem that has spread from the city to surrounding \ncommunities throughout the county. \n\n\n\"There's always been violence in barrios,\" Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. \nPeter E. Brown said. \"Now, we're seeing Oxnard gangs in Santa Barbara, we're \nseeing them in Moorpark, we're seeing them in the Conejo Valley. \n\n\n\"They go in groups, they wear their colors and they go armed,\" he said. \n\n\nSome law enforcement officials say privately that they think many Oxnard \nofficials -- among them Oxnard Police Chief Robert Owens -- have deliberately \ndownplayed the extent of the problem, at least in their public comments about \ngang activity. \n\n\n\"I heard one local chief say that Owens won't admit there are gangs in Oxnard \nuntil one of them shoots him,\" one top official, speaking anonymously, told The \nTimes last week. \n\n\nOwens, who has been Oxnard police chief for 20 years, responded to that comment \nthis week by saying that he thinks he has irritated some law enforcement \nofficials in the county with his policy of avoiding giving gangs unnecessary \npublicity. \n\n\n\"We have an ongoing battle among some people who have been maximizing gang \nactivities,\" he said. \n\n\nOwens said he expressed annoyance recently after another official made what he \nbelieved to be exaggerated statements about an influx of Los Angeles gang \nmembers into Ventura County. \n\n\n\"I accused some of my fellow law enforcement officials of grandstanding and \ngiving gangs what they want -- attention -- and using the announcement for the \ndrama of the moment and more funding from their city,\" he said. \n\n\nDespite the views of others, Owens maintained, Oxnard's gang problem has not \nreached serious proportions. \n\n\n\"Merely because kids identify themselves as gang members doesn't mean we have a \ngang problem,\" he said. \n\n\nOwens conceded that gangs do exist in the city. He stressed, however, that they \nare not comparable to the hard-core street gangs that have become notorious in \nLos Angeles. \n\n\n\"My position has been and will continue to be, until the situation changes, \nthat we have not had the classical gang confrontations -- drive-by shootings, \nmini-wars and battles over turf,\" Owens said. \n\n\n\"Ever since I can remember, there have been areas of the city, barrios, where \nthey affiliate and associate,\" Owens said. \"Once in a while they will have a \ndonnybrook with people in other areas.\" \n\n\nOwens said at least part of his policy of downplaying gang activity stems from \na desire to deny publicity to gangs. \n\n\n\"We try to be very objective and accurate,\" he said. \"It may appear that we're \nminimizing it. We don't think we're doing anybody any favors by giving gangs \nthe publicity that they want.\" \n\n\nThat public policy contrasts with an official Oxnard police assesment of the \ngang situation that was made in a recent application for a $391,000 grant from \nthe U.S. Department of Justice for increased narcotics patrols. \n\n\nIn that application, the Oxnard Police Department said one of the reasons it \nneeds the extra money is because \"gang activity in the city is increasing \nrapidly.\" \n\n\nThe application, approved by Owens, lists the Chiques as the \"oldest and \nlargest gang in the city.\" It also mentions the Crips, which have \"direct \nlinkage with the Los Angeles Crips,\" the Santanas and \"a large number of \nsmaller neighborhood gangs.\" \n\n\nThe application included a newspaper article that quotes a 17-year-old ex-Crips \nmember: \"Being on the streets of Oxnard, I'd say more of the gangs are coming \nfrom Oxnard than anyplace else in Ventura County. A new gang rises up about \nonce a month.\" \n\n\nWhen asked about the discrepancy between his public comments and the language \nused in Oxnard's request for federal funds, Owens said the funding request \ncontained \"dated information\" compiled before two gangs became \"virtually \ninoperative.\" \n\n\nThe chief's views on the gang situation were echoed in recent weeks by Oxnard \npatrol officers, who said they agree that the gang problem has been \nexaggerated. \n\n\nThey described Oxnard youths involved in gangs as \"wanna-bes\" or \"fragmented \ngroups of kids\" or \"little punks\" or \"misguided youth\" -- not a major problem. \n\n\n\"There are very few, very few gangs,\" Officer Dennis McMasters said during a \nrecent patrol. \"If we had hard-core gang members here, you'd have some \nhomicides.\" \n\n\nEven as McMasters minimized gang activity, he was told several times about gang \nactivity by Oxnard citizens and even a fellow officer. \n\n\nMcMasters responded at one point to a call from workers at a warehouse who \ndubbed the vandals who had broken into their facility and left only a bat \nbehind as \"members of that gang, the Lemonwood Chiques.\" \n\n\nAbout an hour later, as McMasters cruised the south end of Oxnard, a motorist \nhonked insistently at him to stop. As McMasters slowed and rolled down his \nwindow, the middle-aged driver pointed toward Oxnard Boulevard. \n\n\n\"'Just over the overpass, there's a hell of a gang fight,\" he said. \n\n\n\"How does he know it was a gang?\" McMasters grumbled before heading to the \noverpass for a look that revealed no activity. \n\n\nA few minutes later, McMasters was told over the radio by another officer that \na similar confrontation had occurred earlier that afternoon. \n\n\nAnd toward the end of his shift, when McMasters stopped for a quick chat with a \nformer partner, the officer said: \n\n\n\"Did you hear about the ICC's big gang fight in Port Hueneme tomorrow?\" \n\n\nAccording to the Ventura County district attorney's office, the two largest \ngangs in Oxnard are the Oxnard Chiques and the Colonia Chiques. \n\n\nAlso in the Colonia are the Loma Flats, who claim to be associated with the Los \nAngeles Bloods. \n\n\nAt the south end of town are the Rolling Sixties Gangster Crips and the Inner \nCity Crips, a Latino gang. \n\n\nOther gangs in the city, according to county officials, are the Lemonwood \nChiques, the Kanto Gang Boys, the Santanas and a predominantly white skinhead \ngang. \n\n\nWhile acknowledging that the gangs exist, Owens maintained this week that they \nare a relatively insignificant factor in Oxnard crime. \n\n\nOwens called the Colonia Chiques \"an amorphous mess.\" He said the city's total \ngang population is about 100. \n\n\nIn downplaying gang activity in Oxnard, Owens has the support of some Oxnard \nCity Council members. \n\n\nCouncilwoman Ann Johs said she saw gang activity during a recent ride-along \nwith police. But she said the gangs should not be glamorized. \n\n\n\"They're there,\" said Johs, a member of the public safety policy commission of \nthe California League of Cities. \"There was one section of town where I could \nphysically see 12 gang members up to no good.\" \n\n\nBut the tactic the city uses, she said, is to not admit that there are gangs. \nIn that way, she said, gangs do not get publicity. \n\n\n\"If they don't get any publicity, they're not as active,\" Johs said. \"Our \npeople know where they are and what they're doing and so far they're not out of \nhand.\" \n\n\nThe Oxnard policy of trying to ignore gangs, while similar to the approach of \nmany cities throughout the state, was questioned by several leading law \nenforcement experts, who termed the approach outdated and potentially \ndangerous. \n\n\nCriminal justice expert G. Albert Howenstein told The Times that any city \npolicy of denying that gangs exist and are a problem \"allows gangs to grow and \ntake control of the neighborhood.\" \n\n\n\"It's important to get them before 'wanna-bes' become 'are-bes,' \" said \nHowenstein, the director of the state office of criminal justice planning. \n\"Whether they're 'wanna-bes' or have signed-up membership cards, the fact that \nthey're 'wanna-bes' should be frightening enough.\" \n\n\nLos Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, who addressed the issue of \nunder-reporting of gang activity at an anti-gang conference, said last week \nthat the downplaying of gang activity often results from pressure by \npoliticians who do not want their cities to be viewed as having such problems. \n\n\n\"I believe the result of political influences is to downplay the negatives in a \ncommunity, particularly as they concern gangs,\" Block said in an interview with \nThe Times. \"Gang violence in a community can impact house prices, commerce and \ntourism.\" \n\n\nVentura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen McLaughlin, who serves as a \ndepartment consultant on gang-related cases, called Oxnard's gang policies \nappropriate, but would not comment further. \n\n\nHowever, he praised the public approach taken by the city of Ventura in dealing \nwith gang problems as \"proactive and progressive.\" \n\n\nThe Ventura Police Department and City Council held news conferences and issued \npress releases to publicize the city's gang problem last March, after a \ndrive-by shooting in front of Ventura High School stunned the community. \n\n\nThe Police Department set up a six-officer suppression team that for the last \nsix months has aggressively enforced ordinances against youths believed to be \nin gangs -- from breaking a 10 p.m. curfew to drinking in public. \n\n\nAnd the Ventura City Council approved $145,000 for an emergency graffiti \nremoval program to paint over the gang slogans that mark different territories \nand established a 24-hour hot line for residents to report graffiti. \n\n\nSanta Paula also has taken a public stance about its admitted gang problem. \n\n\n\"It's difficult to acknowledge the problem without conferring status on the \ngangs,\" said Police Chief Walt Adair. \"By the same token, you can't tell people \nyou don't have a problem when you do.\" \n\n\nDespite the opinions of some officials outside Oxnard, however, other experts \nand many community leaders sided with Owens in portraying Oxnard's problems as \nrelatively minor. Some, in fact, accused the Oxnard police of exaggerating the \ngang problem. \n\n\nArmando Morales, a UCLA professor, studied youth criminal activity in Oxnard \ntwo years ago in a study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice. \n\n\nMorales concluded that many youths belonged to groups characterized as gangs, \nbut that the gangs were nonviolent. \n\n\n\"What I've found in that area was that by and large there are a few gangs in \nthe community, but they are not the violent type,\" Morales said. \n\n\nAt the northeast end of Oxnard, residents of the Colonia, the county's largest \nbarrio, staunchly defended the Colonia Chiques, one of the city's largest \ngangs, as nonviolent. \n\n\nThey said Oxnard youths are unfairly singled out as gang members simply because \nthey may wear the same attire, listen to the same music and paint the same \ngraffiti as authentic gang members. \n\n\n\"We don't believe we have a serious problem in Ventura County,\" said Luzmaria \nEspinosa, a youth counselor at El Concilio del Condado de Ventura. \"We have \nkids who get together, who are friends and who dress a certain way, and because \nthey are, they're considered gangs.\" \n\n\nTimes staff writer Psyche Pascual contributed to this story."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0027", "docId": "179453", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Ventura County; Part J; Page 1; Column 6", "length": "534", "headline": "ANTICIPATED SHORTFALL MAY FORCE COUNTY TO CUT SERVICES;", "byline": "By JOANNA M.

However, Bigler added, \"If we still have a \nshortfall at that time, we would have to recommend reductions.\" \n\n\nBigler said it is too early to be specific, but there probably would be a \npercentage cut in each department's budget. \n\n\nThe county's mental health services may be the exception because of a \n$16-million, four-year state grant to upgrade services. \n\n\nChief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg reported the budgetary outlook \nto county supervisors on Tuesday. At his suggestion, the board approved \nmeasures to continue cost-savings plans implemented last year. \n\n\nWittenberg said the possible shortfall is the kind of dilemma faced by county \ngovernments throughout the state. The state requires counties to provide \nprograms such as welfare and health and hospital care for the poor but does not \nprovide adequate funding to pay the bills, he said. \n\n\n\"County finances are essentially captive to the frequent federal and state \nmandates, political stalemates, allocations priorities and administrative \nwhims,\" he told the board in his report. \"Your board has very limited control \nof the county's future budget destiny.\" \n\n\nFor example, Wittenberg cited the county's receipt of $6.7 million this year in \nnew money from Proposition 99, the tobacco tax initiative. About half of that \namount went to private doctors and hospitals. Another $2 million went to pay \nback the county's general fund for a loan made earlier to the county medical \ncenter. \n\n\nThat loan, Wittenberg said, was for treatment for the poor because of a state \ndecrease in its allocations for the medically indigent last year. \n\n\nAnother problem is that the county's library system spent its entire reserve of \n$318,000 to fund 10 new positions last year, and that will leave this year's \nbudget tight, Bigler said. The library system also wants to build two new \nfacilities at a cost of about $20 million but has no money. \n\n\nThe possible shortfall could also increase the chances that the county will be \nunable to build a proposed 800-bed jail. \n\n\nOfficials already are having to scale back plans and will settle for a jail \nhalf that size to meet their budget constraints. The county now has $41 million \nin state money for the facility, but an 800-bed jail would cost nearly twice \nthat. \n\n\nFor the county to fund the balance with long-term debt, it would need a means \nto repay the loan, which it does not have, said Robert Hirtensteiner, assistant \nto the chief administrative officer. \n\n\nHe said the county is hoping to maintain the status quo with services. \n\n\n\"We're going to try to hold the line,\" he said. \"We will try to maintain the \ncurrent level of services, improve our inefficiencies and cost-effectiveness.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0028", "docId": "179454", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Ventura County; Part J; Page 2; Column 1", "length": "820", "headline": "STATION TIES ORANGE GROVE TO GLOBE;", "byline": "By PEGGY Y.

(COMSAT) station, which opened in 1976, is \nan unassuming facility dwarfed by an array of 42-foot-diameter white antennas \nin the middle of a Santa Paula orange grove. \n\n\n\"The county wanted us to maintain the agricultural aesthetics,\" said Dan Geer, \nstation manager. \"When we picked the site, we were looking for a place close to \nLos Angeles and also permission to use the radio frequencies we want. \n\n\n\"There just happened to be an orange grove there,\" he added. \n\n\nThe 21-member crew of operators and technicians works 24 hours a day, seven \ndays a week to maintain COMSAT satellites and take care of communications among \nships in the Pacific Rim. \n\n\nKeeping the satellites functioning may be routine, but dealing with passenger \nliners, oil tankers and fishing boats provides the element of unpredictability \nand variety at the station. \n\n\nActing Operator Supervisor Debbie Schneider recalled that the station was \"very \nhectic\" last March when the tanker Exxon Valdez spilled tons of oil in Alaska. \n\n\nCOMSAT helped by setting up a special 24-hour communications link among the \nships involved in the cleanup. A framed certificate of commendation from Exxon \nhangs in the COMSAT station now, along with pictures and posters of cruise \nships, oil drilling rigs and fishing boats. \n\n\nA natural disaster such as an earthquake will also increase the station's \nactivity, Schneider said. After ships received news that the big quake had \nstruck the Bay Area, operators had to deal with frantic customers trying to \ncall home. \n\n\n\"We couldn't get through for a day and a half,\" she said. \"There is no \nsatellite station in San Francisco. If there was, there wouldn't have been a \nproblem.\" \n\n\nEmergency calls are routed to the Coast Guard by one of COMSAT's eight \noperators who give personal assistance if customers need help dialing \nship-to-shore, shore-to-ship or ship-to-ship. They also assist with telex and \nfacsimile calls, Schneider said. \n\n\nUsually, however, workdays at the COMSAT station are routine, Geer said. \n\n\nAbout 50% of the work schedule involves maintaining the satellites, about 40% \nis devoted to telephone, telex and data services for ships and the remaining \n10% is spent transmitting Armed Forces radio news broadcasts to Pacific ships \nand sending British and domestic television programs to Australia, Geer said. \n\n\nRegular satellite maintenance and television transmission is routinely done by \ncomputers -- huge, gray machines that constantly hum and that occupy most of \nthe station space. A satellite alarm and a minimum of two technicians on duty \nensure that the satellite stays in orbit and functions correctly. \"We've got a \nbackup for almost everything you can think of,\" Geer said. \n\n\nAccording to COMSAT, nearly half of all worldwide telecommunications traffic \nbegins and ends in the United States. COMSAT has a sister station in Southbury, \nConn., that services the Atlantic Ocean. More than 10,000 ships use satellite \nservice, and nearly half use COMSAT on a regular basis. \n\n\nThat translates into more than 2,000 calls a day during a peak period, \nSchneider said. The busiest time of year is from April to October, when \"Alaska \nopens up,\" she said. COMSAT receives a lot of business from the cruise ships, \nfishing vessels and oil tankers in that area. \n\n\nThe advantage of using satellites for phone calls is privacy, high quality \ntransmissions and fast connections, Schneider said. \n\n\nBut satellite service is not cheap. A phone call costs $10 per minute, with a \nthree-minute minimum, and a telex is $4 per minute. \n\n\nDespite the high rates, business is growing, Geer said. A large expansion is \nplanned for next year. The COMSAT station owns 10 acres but is now only using \nfour. \n\n\nThe Communications Satellite Corp. is a Washington company that owns and \noperates seven domestic satellites plus a satellite-based television \ndistribution network. \n\n\nCustomers include the U.S. Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, \nVoice of America and the governments of the Federal Republic of Germany, \nTurkey, Japan, Korea and Italy. \n\n\nThe company was formed in 1963 by an act of Congress to pioneer the development \nof a commercial international communications satellite system, and launched its \nfirst satellite in 1976. President John F. Kennedy picked its first board of \ndirectors, but COMSAT received no government funds and has always been listed \non the New York Stock Exchange, said COMSAT spokeswoman Pat Whalen. \n\n\nThe company employs more than 1,500 people worldwide and revenues are about \n$400 million."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0029", "docId": "179461", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Westside; Part J; Page 2; Column 3", "length": null, "headline": null, "byline": null, "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, The Shoe Must Go On In preparation for an upcoming horse show at Sunset \nRanch in Hollywood, Jack Pitts hammers and shapes the horseshoe, files a \nhorse's hoof, and nails the shoe into place.

While growers feared the potential damage of the \nfreeze, they cheered the rain that began Friday and lasted through Sunday. \n\n\n\"Even if there were potential damage to the crops from rain we wouldn't care \nbecause we need the rain so badly,\" McGrath said. \n\n\nThe rain, while substantial, was enough to bring the county up to only 48% of \nits normal rainfall total for this time of year, said Dolores Taylor, county \nhydrologist. \n\n\nThe storm dropped nearly four inches of rain at Matilija Dam above Ojai, \ntypically the wettest spot in the county, and more than an inch in Ventura, \nTaylor said. It was the second large storm of the season. \n\n\n\"It still brought less than we needed,\" Taylor said. \"We've still got a long \nway to go yet.\" Ideally, Taylor said, the county would receive three more \nstorms bringing two inches each. \n\n\n\"But if we got it all at once, as long as there was no death or destruction, \nthat would be OK too,\" she said. \n\n\nThe county's fourth year of drought could be eased somewhat next week if a new \nstorm arrives as predicted. \n\n\nSchaeffer predicts that warmer temperatures in the 60s on the coast and 70s \ninland late this week will give way to cooler weather and more rain by Monday. \n\n\nGrowers welcome rain as both an end to drought conditions that plague the \ncounty and as protection against frost. Moisture, either falling or in the \nground, keeps ground temperatures up and lessens the chance of a hard freeze, \nSchaeffer said. \n\n\nIn the weeks leading up to last week's freeze, the ground was dry and the sky \nwas clear, Schaeffer said. There was no cloud cover to hold in warm air. \n\n\n\"It was a bad frost,\" McGrath said. \"It was the kind where we had no ceiling, \nso that any type of protection from heaters or wind machines was ineffective.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0033", "docId": "179471", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Ventura County; Part J; Page 8; Column 3", "length": "940", "headline": "JONES FINDS THE FAST LANE;", "byline": "By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, Freshman sprinter Marion Jones is following fast on the heels of \nrecord-setting runner Angela Burnham, perhaps Rio Mesa High's most successful \nathlete. ; Photo, Jones' time in the Sunkist Invitational 50-yard dash was the \nbest ever by a ninth grader and sixth best by a prep.

LAWRENCE K. HO / Los Angeles Times", "text": "When Angela Burnham graduated last June and took her talents to UCLA, Rio Mesa \nHigh track Coach Brian FitzGerald figured that another athlete of her caliber \nwould not come along soon. \n\n\nAfter all, Burnham had won five state titles in her four years at Rio Mesa, \nincluding 100- and 200-meter titles in her junior and senior years. \n\n\nShe had also run in the Olympic Trials and twice was honored as Track & \nField News magazine's female high school athlete of the year. \n\n\nNo, Burnham was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime kind of talent for a high \nschool coach. \n\n\nBut a telephone call FitzGerald received only eight weeks later caused him to \nreevaluate his thinking. \n\n\nOn the phone was Marion Jones, who informed FitzGerald that her daughter, also \nMarion, would be moving to Camarillo from Sherman Oaks to attend Rio Mesa in \nthe fall. \n\n\nThis was the same Marion Jones who had smashed Burnham's national age-13 record \nin the 200 meters (24.90 seconds) with a 24.30 clocking during the summer -- a \ntime which would have placed second behind only Burnham in the Southern Section \n3-A Division finals last season. \n\n\nThis was the same Marion Jones who had run personal bests of 12.01 in the 100 \nand 56.98 at 400 meters as an eighth grader. \n\n\n\"I had read about her and I knew who she was,\" FitzGerald said. \"I said to \nmyself, 'Boy, it would sure be great to have her,' and the next thing I knew \nshe was coming here.\" \n\n\nComparisons with Burnham are likely to arise as the season progresses, but \nJones, 14, would prefer to focus on herself. \n\n\n\"(The state meet) is a long way off,\" she said. \"I just want to try my best and \nsee what happens. Angela is a very fast runner and her records will be tough to \nbeat.\" \n\n\nWhile the two are certain to be compared by their performances on the track, \nthey are very different off it. \n\n\n\"Angela is Angela, and Marion is Marion,\" FitzGerald said. \"The only similarity \nis that they run very fast. Their personalities are complete opposites. Marion \nis a real aggressive and gregarious kid. Angela was very shy and quiet as a \nfreshman.\" \n\n\nBurnham's younger sister, Alycia, a junior at Rio Mesa who also competes on the \ntrack team, also notices a difference. \n\n\n\"Marion is real outgoing and likes to joke around,\" Alycia said. \"She's real \nnice, but if she doesn't like something, she's not afraid to let people know. \n\n\n\"Angela is real quiet and likes to keep things to herself even when she's happy \nor does well.\" \n\n\nJones would have originally attended either Montclair Prep or Notre Dame, but a \nneighbor, whom Jones calls a \"a great track fan,\" suggested that she should \nattend Rio Mesa. \n\n\n\"People will talk about recruiting,\" FitzGerald said, \"but the fact is I think \nher mom was just shopping around to find the best place for her daughter to \ndevelop. I'm not trying toot my own horn, but I think our results speak for \nthemselves.\" \n\n\nRio Mesa has has won seven league titles in the past eight years, tied for the \nstate title in the girls' division in 1988 and finished second last year. \n\n\nThe outdoor season has yet to begin, but Jones put herself into the record \nbooks indoors at last month's Sunkist Invitational at the Sports Arena. \n\n\nRunning on the boards for the first time, Jones won the girls' 50-yard dash \n(6.53), ran the opening leg on the Spartans' winning 640-yard relay team and \nanchored Rio Mesa's winning mile relay team with a 57.7-second split. \n\n\nHer time in the 50 was the fastest ever by a ninth grader and ranks sixth on \nthe all-time high school performance list. \n\n\nFitzGerald was especially impressed with Jones' 440-yard leg in the mile relay. \n\n\n\"She's a big girl to be running on such a small track . . . and hasn't really \nbeen training for the quarter,\" FitzGerald said of Jones, who stands 5 foot 9 \nand weighs 130 pounds. \n\n\nIn fact, Jones hasn't had much time to train for track at all: She has been \nplaying on Rio Mesa's basketball team. \n\n\nJones led the team in scoring (21.2) and rebounding (14.4) and helped Rio Mesa \n(9-15) win a Southern Section playoffs. \n\n\n\"She jumps so quickly and explosively it's hard to describe,\" said Rio Mesa \ngirls' basketball Coach Al Walker of Jones, who is able to touch a 10-foot rim. \n\"She's very confident and just dominates the defensive backboard and \noffensively at the post. She's very competitive and aggressive.\" \n\n\nThat competitiveness was apparent even during the first week of track practice \nin the fall. \n\n\n\"We were just doing some repeats up a hill with the cross-country team,\" Alycia \nsaid. \"Nothing fast, just trying to get into shape and on the first one, Marion \ntook off and just starts to run full speed up the hill. We just said 'Marion, \nMarion, relax! We have to do more.' She just looked at Fitz and gave him the \nstrangest look and said 'What? Aw man.' \". \n\n\nBut Jones speaks in a very serious tone when she discusses another sport she \nwould like to play. \n\n\n\"I'd like to give football a try, just on the high school level, not in \ncollege,\" Jones said. \"It's been done before. Hueneme had one girl and Channel \nIslands had two girls that have played. \n\n\n\"I think I can play wide receiver, just like Jerry Rice (of the San Francisco \n49ers). I can catch the ball and I'm fast enough to run with it. \" \n\n\nWorried about injury? \n\n\n\"It's just like any sport,\" Jones said. \"You don't go looking to get hurt. It \nit does, it's just an accident. It's a risk you have to take.\" \n\n\nFitzGerald, apparently unaware of Jones' ambitions, shook his head in disbelief \nto a reporter. \n\n\n\"She actually told you that?\" he said. \"She's really talented, but that idea is \nreally kind of far-fetched.\" \n\n\nYes, Marion is Marion and Angela is Angela. \n\n\nThey both run fast. \n\n\nThat's where the similarity ends."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0034", "docId": "179472", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Ventura County; Part J; Page 8; Column 2", "length": "1733", "headline": "LAUT: AFRICAN TOUR NOT BLACK, WHITE", "byline": "By KEN McALPINE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, Former Olympic shot putter Dave Laut would like to carry the stars and \nstripes into competition -- legally -- in South Africa. LAWRENCE K. HO / Los \nAngeles Times; Photo, COLOR, NO REGRETS: Dave Laut, an Oxnard resident, ignored \nan international ban on competition in South Africa in 1988 and made the \nlongest shot put ever on South African soil. The Oxnard resident, who competed \nin the 1984 Olympics, received a four-year ban on competition. A more recent \ntrip to South Africa could earn him a lifetime ban.", "text": "On the day he entered a national record book, Oxnard real estate salesman Dave \nLaut wasn't even sure he should have been competing. \n\n\nLaut, a shot putter, was at Pilditch Stadium on the outskirts of Pretoria, \nSouth Africa, on that October day in 1988, part of a contingent of 14 track and \nfield athletes from the United States who had chosen to ignore an international \nban on competition in South Africa. They were risking their eligibility by \ncompeting in a country where apartheid in sanctioned by law. \n\n\nLaut admitted he had mixed emotions as he stepped into the shot-put ring at \nPilditch, with 16 pounds of metal tucked between shoulder and chin. \n\n\n\"I mean here I was, about to throw the shot in South Africa, and I'm thinking, \n'Are you sure you want to do this?' \" recalled Laut, who swallowed his emotions \nlong enough to launch a 66-foot put -- the longest ever on South African soil. \n\"I really had the adrenaline going on that one.\" \n\n\nThe Athletics Congress, the governing body for track and field in the United \nStates, recognized Laut's record by handing him a four-year ban from \ncompetition. However Laut, an Olympian in 1984, is far from repentant -- \nrecently he returned from his third trip to South Africa, a decision he fully \nexpects will earn him yet another ban, this time for life. \n\n\n\"I'm guessing, but they'll probably give us a lifetime (ban) now because we \nwent back,\" said Laut of the five-meet tour in which he and 13 teammates \nparticipated in November. \"I'm waiting to get the letter any day.\" \n\n\nNine of the U. S. athletes who participated in the original October, 1988, tour \nreceived TAC suspensions ranging from two to 12 years. \n\n\nLaut, 33, said there is no simple reason for his decision to risk punishment by \ncompeting in South Africa, although money was an important factor. \n\n\nA standout shot putter at Santa Clara High, Moorpark College, San Jose City \nCollege and UCLA, Laut earned a bronze medal at the Los Angeles Olympics. The \nfollowing year he won the TAC outdoor championships and, buoyed by those \nperformances, drew a bead on the 1988 Olympics. \n\n\nLooking for a job that would provide him with both the cash and the time to \ntrain, Laut tried out in the summer of 1986 for a position with the Oxnard Fire \nDepartment. While running with a fire hose, he felt a sharp pain in both knees. \nRuptured tendons sent him sprawling to the pavement. \n\n\nThe following year, which Laut should have spent in training for the Olympics, \nwas consumed instead with rehabilitation. His few performances were poor and he \nlost both his momentum and valuable financial support from Nike. \n\n\nWhen he took a part-time time as a realtor, his training suffered. At the 1988 \nOlympic Trials in Indianapolis, Laut, who needed to finish in the top three to \nwin a spot on the team, placed fifth. \n\n\nWhen Skip Robinson, the track coach at Pasadena City College, approached Laut \nat the trials and proposed a possible tour of South Africa, Laut was \napprehensive. Robinson was straightforward -- he told Laut this would be the \nfirst such tour since 1962 and the first since the International Amateur \nAthletic Federation banned South Africa from international track and field \ncompetition in 1976. \n\n\nAny athlete who went likely would face repercussions. Laut, however, was ready \nto take a chance. \n\n\n\"It sounded like a pretty serious commitment, but I'd lost my contract (with \nNike) and things were looking pretty bad, so I thought, 'Well, why not take a \nchance and see?' \" said Laut. \n\n\nAccording to published reports, the U.S. athletes were paid a minimum of \n$10,000 per meet during the 1988 tour and, with performance bonuses, could earn \nmuch more. Miler Jim Spivey claimed he was offered $200,000 to compete in the \nmeets. \n\n\nSpivey declined the offer. \n\n\nThough Laut refused to discuss specifics, he said he was paid somewhere between \n$10,000 and $30,000. Whatever the sum, said Laut, money was the only way to get \nathletes to take the risk. \n\n\n\"You're not going to ask an athlete to risk his eligibility and his whole \nsports career without paying them for it,\" Laut said. \n\n\nThough money spurred Laut to take his first trip to South Africa in the fall of \n1988, subsequent trips in April and November were taken for other reasons. \n\n\n\"South Africa is the only place in the world I can compete now,\" Laut said. \n\n\n\"I think that everyone who's gone over there has a goal and we're committed to \nseeing it through,\" added Laut, whose tour teammates have included Olympians \nJohn Powell, Ruth Wysocki, Tom Petranoff and Gregg Tafralis. \"Hopefully through \nour efforts and what we're doing we'll maybe make a dent on this ban on sports \nover there.\" \n\n\nNot everyone agrees. When plans for the first tour were announced, many decried \nthe idea, saying it would lend legitimacy to a political system that allows \nSouth Africa's 27 million blacks no vote and little voice. Critics say the \ntours have fostered no change, and many accuse the athletes who participated of \nignoring moral concerns for financial benefit. \n\n\n\"The people that went there, they know its wrong,\" said George Mehale, a South \nAfrican who coaches track and field at Cal State Long Beach. \"Nothing changed \nbecause they went.\" \n\n\n\"If anything, people are telling me informally that in a way they hurt the \ncause -- not major injury, but they certainly did set things back,\" said TAC \nPresident Frank Greenberg, one of several TAC officials who voted to ban the \nathletes who participated in the 1988 tour. \"I think it's counterproductive \nwhen individuals go. Global reaction against South Africa is getting stronger, \nthat pressure has already produced some changes.\" \n\n\nSupporters of sanctions against South Africa say the sanctions contributed to \nPresident Frederik De Klerk's recent decisions to release political prisoners \nsuch as Walter Sisulu and Nelson Mandela. \n\n\nDe Klerk also lifted a decades-old ban on the African National Congress and \nmore than a dozen other groups dedicated to the abolition of apartheid; eased \ngovernment censorship of the media; and asked his justice department to reserve \ncapital penalties for the most severe crimes. \n\n\nBut De Klerk, whose Nationalist Party has ruled South Africa since 1948 and is \nthus responsible for instituting the most repulsive separatist laws, left most \nof the pillars of apartheid intact. The pass laws, which require blacks to \ncarry legal documents when traveling outside their townships, are still \nenforced and the nation's black citizens are still not entitled to participate \nin the government or in national elections. \n\n\nLaut prefers to steer clear of debate. Others, however, vehemently defend the \ntours. \n\n\n\"We spent time doing clinics, promoting goodwill and helping people of all \ncolors,\" said tour organizer and coach Dick Tomlinson. \"Ours is a purely \nhumanitarian effort. We're trying to bring understanding and turn the lights on \nthe South African situation so people will realize that there are millions of \nblack South Africans who are being deprived of international sport.\" \n\n\nLaut said he has seen few signs of segregation during his trips to South \nAfrica. Critics argue that Laut and his fellow athletes were sheltered from \napartheid's worst. Although they were free to travel as they wished -- \nincluding visits to the volatile black townships of Soweto and Crossroads -- \none team member admitted there was \"a strong possibility\" she and her fellow \nathletes were sheltered during their visit. \n\n\n\"We did go different places, but they had an itinerary set up with where they \nwere going to take us and what we were going to do,\" said Pamela Page, a \nhurdler who participated in the most recent tour. Page, who is black, also said \nthat despite outward appearances of normalcy, something was amiss. \n\n\n\"People were nice and they kept saying, 'We're trying to change, we're trying \nto change,' but it was still strange,\" Page said. \"I'd be shopping and they \n(white South Africans) would just kind of stop and look at me like, 'Wait a \nminute.' It kind of caught them off guard.\" \n\n\nBut while Laut admits he knows little about South Africa's politics, he does \nknow something of sport and he sees in South Africa a potential track \npowerhouse. \n\n\n\"There's just an unbelievable amount of talent over there, it's just amazing,\" \nLaut said. \"If they could become a part of the world, they would be a major \npower in track and field in 10 years. That's my sincere belief.\" \n\n\nDuring the November tour, Laut and the rest of the U. S. contingent met briefly \nwith De Klerk. According to Laut, the president lent his support to the tour \nand expressed hope that the South African athletes would soon be able to \ncompete internationally. \n\n\n\"They've got a lot of national pride and I think they would really like to see \ntheir country get back into international competition,\" Laut said. \n\n\nLaut also expresses admiration for the South African athletes who continue to \ntrain and compete in the face of an international ban that keeps them at home, \nleaving them to compete against the same faces in the same places. \n\n\n\"When I was in high school and college I always had that Olympic medal as my \ndream. That was my focus, the driving force that kept me going . . . ,\" Laut \nsaid. \"The South African athlete doesn't have that dream, but he keeps working \nas hard as we do, maybe harder. To me that determination is amazing.\" \n\n\nFor Laut, training and competition have also taken on a slightly different \nslant from his college days. He has pared his training substantially -- \nslipping away from work in the afternoon to put the shot at Hueneme High or \nlift weights in the garage of his home. \n\n\n\"If I'm lucky, I can get in two hours of training a day,\" Laut said. \"It's not \nwhat I need, but I know what to do now and I can eliminate a lot of the \nnonsense stuff that I used to do.

Wilkes, a sophomore forward, \nstarted alongside junior Larry Farmer, sophomore center Bill Walton, and senior \nguard Henry Bibby and sophomore Greg Lee. \n\n\nWilkes, formerly known as Keith Wilkes in high school and college, continued \nhis career with the Golden State Warriors where he was selected Rookie of the \nYear in 1974-75 and the Los Angeles Lakers. \n\n\nIn high school, Wilkes, nicknamed Silk, played his junior year at Ventura \nbefore transfering to Santa Barbara. \n\n\nAlthough his teams failed to reach the finals, Wilkes was selected the Southern \nSection (Major Division) Player of the Year in 1970. \n\n\nAnticipation: The name Lisa Leslie would strike fear into most opposing high \nschool girls' basketball coaches. After all, the 6-foot-5 Morningside senior \nscored 101 points in one half two weeks ago. \n\n\nBut Channel Islands Coach Ryle Lynch-Cole wanted the opportunity to play \nMorningside, the defending Southern Section Division 5-AA champion and see how \nthe Raiders' 6-0 junior center Sal Tauau matches up against Leslie. \n\n\n\"It's been one of our goals all season to play Morningside,\" Lynch-Cole said. \n\"We wanted Sal to get a shot at playing against her before (Leslie) graduates.\" \n\n\nAnd with a 44-42 win over Alhambra on Saturday night in a second round playoff \ngame, Lynch-Cole had his wish fulfilled.

LAWRENCE K. HO / Los Angeles Times", "text": "Oxnard Police Officer Dennis McMasters pointed the flashlight's high beam into \nthe suspect's face and scrutinized the man's pupils -- tiny black dots swimming \nin large, brown eyes. \n\n\n\"You've been using, haven't you?\" McMasters said. \"You're afraid I'm going to \narrest you, aren't you?\" \n\n\nMcMasters examined the 35-year-old's arms, beginning at the wrist and following \nthe blue-green vein to the inside of the elbow, where it bulged uncomfortably \nin a knot. \n\n\nHe checked the backs of both hands and arms, ignoring the tattoo of the woman \nwith flowing hair in his search for needle marks. \n\n\nThe man chattered nervously about the drug rehabilitation program he had \ncompleted and insisted he was clean before McMasters let him go toward the \norange and blue room doors that dismally offset the beige pallor of the nearby \nmotel. \n\n\n\"He's on heroin,\" McMasters said. \"He's been like that forever.\" \n\n\nIt was the middle of a typical police swing shift in Oxnard -- where everyone \nfrom the police chief to the patrol officer cites drugs as the city's biggest \ncrime problem. \n\n\n\"It's not hard to go out and find people under the influence of heroin,\" said \nMcMasters, who was patrolling city neighborhoods south of Woolley Road and east \nof Saviers Road during a recent 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. shift. \n\n\nOxnard -- with its memories of bar shoot-outs, riots against police and barrio \nwarfare, according to Owens -- long ago assumed the mantle of the crime capital \nof Ventura County. \n\n\nThe FBI crime statistics for 1988 showed Oxnard's crime rate to be twice the \ncounty average, with 7,816 crimes per 100,000 citizens, double the rate of \n3,875.6 for the county and higher than the national average of 5,664.2. \n\n\nDespite the growing drug problem and the FBI statistics, Police Chief Robert \nOwens said, the city's reputation for crime is unwarranted. \n\n\n\"It's the parochialism of people in Ventura and Camarillo that they enjoy \nlooking down their noses at Oxnard,\" Owens said. \n\n\nPeople who think Oxnard is violent are carrying old perceptions from the days \nwhen the Colonia, the largest barrio in Ventura County, was dangerous, Owens \nsaid. \n\n\n\"It's very hard to get people to forget legends,\" Owens said. \"There was a time \nwhen the Colonia used to strike fear into people, when you couldn't walk down \nthe street without getting beaten up or stabbed or shot or robbed at least.\" \n\n\nOwens said crime has been on a downward trend since 1978. However, he said, \nthat trend has reversed itself -- with crime rising by 17% since city budget \nproblems forced cuts in field personnel. \n\n\nThe city restored about $115,000 to the department budget this fall, but Owens \nis still short on officers. \n\n\n\"I'm not saying the cuts resulted directly in increased crime, but you can't \nignore them,\" he said. \n\n\nThe time it takes police cars to respond to a call has risen from 4.57 minutes \nduring the 1987-88 fiscal year to 5.47 minutes since the budget cuts. \n\n\n\"It doesn't augur well for public safety,\" Owens said. \n\n\nOwens' description of the level of crime in Oxnard was supported by two \nrelatively tranquil ride-alongs with police in recent weeks. \n\n\nThe officers fielded a variety of calls -- checking dead bodies for foul play, \ncalming parents involved in custody disputes and quieting noisy parties. \n\n\nWhen not answering calls, McMasters cruised his beat -- circling neighborhood \ntrouble spots, heading down back alleys and gracefully maneuvering his car \naround wooden barriers to drive through deserted parks. \n\n\nMcMasters suspiciously watched everything from two boys walking down a sidewalk \nto a bright blue Pontiac that he thought waited too long at a stop sign. \n\n\nMuch of the city's crime is found along the central corridor of Saviers Road \nand Oxnard Boulevard. But there are pockets of crime in neighborhoods that \ntypify suburbia and areas of palatial homes. \n\n\nMore and more crime is found in the Southwinds area in south Oxnard. In the \nColonia, patrol cars still carry two officers. And a location described by \npolice as the most infamous Oxnard crime spot -- the condemned Lemon Tree Hotel \n-- stands on Meta Street just a few blocks from downtown. \n\n\nAnd everywhere, the officers contend with the city's drug problem. \n\n\nIn 1984, officers made 947 drug-related arrests. In 1989, they made 2,972 such \narrests. \n\n\nOwens is applying to the U.S. Department of Justice for a $391,000 grant to \ncreate a \"Street Sales Enforcement Team,\" four officers who would deal \nspecifically with narcotics crimes and field calls from a drug hot line. \n\n\nHe attributes the Oxnard drug problem in part to demographics, postulating that \nOxnard may have a greater number of the 20- to-30-year-olds who use drugs than \nother county cities. \n\n\nYears ago, Oxnard was the place to come for heroin. Its airport and harbor \nprovided good access for bringing it into the city, police say. \n\n\nIn turn, heroin was the drug of choice for most Oxnard users. \n\n\nNow officers say that popularity has been conferred on crack cocaine. \n\n\n\"You can find kids all the time smoking that crack,\" McMasters said. \"It's \nunbelievable. It really is.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0038", "docId": "179543", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Food; Part H; Page 30; Column 1", "length": "280", "headline": "BACK TO BASICS: NEWS FOR AFICIONADOS: HEART OF ARTICHOKE SEASON IS LONGER THIS \nYEAR", "byline": "By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, Step 1 -- Cut stem off near base so artichoke stands upright evenly. ; \nPhoto, Step 2 -- Turn artichoke around and trim off a quarter to third of top. \n; Photo, Step 3 -- Snip off thorny tips of remaining leaves with kitchen \nshears. ; Photo, Step 4 -- Rub all surfaces with cut lemon to prevent \ndiscoloration. ; Photo, Step 5 -- Spread leaves and remove core, if desired, \nbefore cooking. ; Photo, Step 6 -- Scrape out the fuzzy choke with a serrated \nspoon.

Business in \nTijuana's restaurants is down 35% and room occupancy rates are down 60%. \n\n\nBusiness at gift and curio shops in Rosarito, just south of Tijuana, is down \n30% and some restaurants are closing, officials say. \n\n\nSome tourism officials blame the state government's lack of tourism promotion \nfor its woes. Other say it is the recent increase in toll fees along the scenic \n65-mile Tijuana-Ensenada coastal road. Fees recently tripled to $2.25 for each \nof the three toll stations between the two cities. \n\n\nOthers blame the troubles on the 2 1/2-month-old strike at Caliente Racetrack, \nwhile others say long lines at the border crossings also discourage tourism. \n\n\n\"Visitors come to Rosarito for a few hours to eat and shop and have a good \ntime,\" said Hugo Torres Chabert, owner of the Rosarito Beach Hotel and an \nadviser to the town's tourism bureau. \n\n\n\"Then, when they want to return home, what awaits them at the border? A \ntwo-hour wait. They become discouraged and will think twice before making the \ntrip down here again,\" he said. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Tijuana tourism officials say their economy also is being affected \nby local residents crossing to San Diego. The tourism bureau says Tijuana \nresidents spent $1.5 billion in San Diego stores last year. \n\n\nMax Schetter, senior vice president of the Greater San Diego Chamber of \nCommerce, said that although the chamber has no current statistics on Mexicans' \nfinancial effect on San Diego, Tijuana's figures were \"probably in the \nballpark.\" \n\n\nBoth Torres and Schetter say a third border crossing is needed. \n\n\n\"Those long waits do deter trade and do deter a healthy transportation flow,\" \nSchetter said. \"It acts as a restraint to free flow of traffic between two good \nneighbors.\" \n\n\nCustoms officials say that the wait at border crossings is usually about 45 \nminutes, but that the number of daily crossings continues to grow. \n\n\nIn the meantime, Mexican tourism officials will try to overcome the current \ncrisis. \n\n\n\"We realize that the pie is not that big anymore, that the competition from San \nDiego and our own backyard is growing larger,\" Yu said. \"We need to create a \nbetter tourism infrastructure that will attract a steady influx of visitors on \na year-round basis.\" \n\n\nBut some tourism officials say the decrease in tourists is normal for the \nwinter. \n\n\n\"It's winter.

Hoff and Richard P. Schaaf, picked them up on \nstreet corners downtown, stole cash from their wallets, then dumped them in an \nisolated area near some railroad tracks. \n\n\nOne of the undocumented workers, Rolando Carrera Reyes, added that Hoff struck \nhim several times with his police flashlight in the testicles, tossed his shoes \nin a dirty puddle of water and pushed him into the water. \n\n\nHoff and Schaaf are charged with felony counts of kidnaping and robbery and, if \nconvicted, could be sentenced to life in prison. Although police officials said \nthe two officers were in the process of being fired once the charges were filed \nlast month, defense attorney Everett Bobbitt said Wednesday that Hoff and \nSchaaf are still officers and continue to receive paychecks. \n\n\nThey are charged with kidnaping three illegal aliens, but Craig Rooten, the \ndeputy district attorney who is prosecuting the case, said one of the alleged \nvictims, identified as Ramiro Rodriguez, has not been located. \n\n\nThe other two men -- Carrera Reyes and Arturo Romero Garcia -- appeared in \ncourt Wednesday at the opening of a preliminary hearing before Municipal Judge \nNicholas Kasimatis to determine whether there is enough evidence to justify \nthem standing trial on the charges. \n\n\nBoth men, testifying through a Spanish-language interpreter, said they have \nused many aliases over the years and had come to this country illegally. A \nspecial videotape was made to preserve their testimony should they flee this \ncountry before the case goes to trial. \n\n\nUpon his arrival at the courthouse to testify, Carrera Reyes was arrested on \nhalf a dozen outstanding warrants, the most serious of which named him for \npossession of marijuana for sale. After stepping down from the stand, he was \nled off to jail. \n\n\nIn his testimony, he said Officers Hoff and Schaaf stopped him after he left a \ndowntown disco and drove him to a secluded and dark area near a set of railroad \ntracks. He said they took $25 from his wallet and tore up his identification \nand other papers. He said that they tossed the wallet onto the ground and that \nHoff struck him with the flashlight. \n\n\n\"He struck me again in the testicles, then he turned me around and hit me in \nthe hand with his flashlight,\" Carrera Reyes said. \"He told me to take my shoes \noff. I took them off. He looked at them, and then he threw them in the water, \nsome dirty water that flows out of there. \n\n\n\"They just threw me into the water then and left me there.\" \n\n\nCarrera Reyes also testified about an incident a year earlier in which, he \nsaid, the same two officers stopped him on the street, took his money and drove \nhim and another illegal alien, identified only as Enrique, to National City. \n\n\n\"They just took my money,\" Carrera Reyes said. \"They took me to National City \nand dropped me off at a bridge. They just let me out.\" \n\n\nUnder cross-examination, Carrera Reyes said he had just gotten out of jail when \nhe was stopped in August and he lied to police detectives about whether he had \na job at the time he was allegedly kidnaped and robbed. He admitted using \nmarijuana, but said he does not use hard drugs or drink beer. \n\n\n\"I've never been caught for selling, but I was arrested once for having 51 \nmarijuana cigarettes,\" he said. \n\n\nThe second alleged victim, Garcia, testified in a jail uniform. Rooten said \nGarcia is serving time for auto burglary. \n\n\nGarcia told the court he once was charged with killing a transient, after \npolice found him with a lot of blood on his arm.

The proposed settlement calls for the city to complete the \nlargest public works project in its history by Dec. 31, 2003, in order to \ncomply with federal Clean Water Act sewage treatment provisions. \n\n\nThe upgrading to so-called \"secondary\" standards would improve the city's \nsewage treatment by 10% over the existing \"advanced primary\" system before the \nwaste is dumped into the ocean. Under plans designed by the city and its \nconsultant, as much as 135 million gallons of sewage daily would eventually be \n\"reclaimed\" for reuse in irrigation by further cleansing. \n\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Justice Department and the \nRegional Water Quality Control Board sued the city in July, 1988, to force \nconstruction of the project and demand payment of fines for city sewage spills \nfrom 1983 to 1988. The fines have been set aside for future negotiations or a \nseparate trial. \n\n\nAt issue in the hearing is whether the Sierra Club can persuade Brewster to \nbind the City Council to mandatory water conservation measures that include \nreplacement of every toilet in the Metropolitan Sewerage System with ultra-low \nvolume 1.6-gallon toilets. The district includes 1.7 million people in San \nDiego and 15 other cities and sewer districts. \n\n\nBy ordering the toilet conversions and other plumbing changes, the system's \ncurrent 190 million-gallon daily sewage flow can be reduced to 160 million \ngallons, even as the city grows over the next 13 years, the Sierra Club claims. \nThe proposed sewage system could be substantially smaller, according to the \nenvironmental organization, saving city taxpayers $200 million to $1 billion \noff the $2.6-billion to $2.8-billion estimated price tag. \n\n\nThe City Council, which Tuesday took its first look at planning for a less \nambitious, 12-point water conservation plan being developed by city staffers, \nopposes inclusion of water conservation measures in the legal settlement, \npreferring to develop the conservation measures separately. \n\n\nThe city and the three other government agencies -- longtime adversaries -- are \nnow allied against the Sierra Club and co-intervenor Emily Durbin as a result \nof their agreement last month to settle their differences. \n\n\nIn legal papers and oral arguments Wednesday, city and Justice Department \nattorneys said nothing in the Clean Water Act requires inclusion of water \nconservation measures in a legal settlement that covers treatment of waste. In \naddition, they argued, the Sierra Club's estimates of conservation benefits are \nan unproven, risky foundation on which to base design of an expensive sewage \ntreatment system that will serve the city until 2050. \n\n\nJustice Department attorney Gerald George also asserted that Brewster lacks the \nauthority to add the provisions to the legal settlement. \n\n\n\"It is difficult to argue that what the Sierra Club is asking for is required \nby law when, 20 years after the Clean Water Act was passed, they can point to \nno case where it was ordered,\" George said. \n\n\nJames Dragna, a private attorney representing the city, said after the hearing \nthat the Sierra Club demands -- and the sewer hookup moratorium in particular \n-- are a covert attempt to use design of the sewage treatment system to slow or \nstop growth. \n\n\n\"The Sierra Club attempts to litigate this radical anti-growth program by \ncloaking it in the guise of objections\" to provisions of the legal settlement, \nDragna's legal papers said. \n\n\nSimmons also objected to elements of the settlement that would allow the city \nto gradually raise a 210 million-gallon daily cap on sewage treated at the \ncity's Point Loma plant as the plant's capacity is expanded. \n\n\nHe also wants Brewster to reject the plan's water reclamation provisions \nbecause the city would be required to reuse only 50% of the 89 million gallons \nthat would be reclaimed each day by 2010."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0044", "docId": "179632", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition", "section": "Metro; Part B; Page 2; Column 1", "length": "161", "headline": "METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA MOVING TO PHASE OUT USE OF CFCS", "byline": null, "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "The Santa Monica City Council this week directed the city attorney to draft an \nordinance that would phase out the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, \nor CFCs, over two years.

Silberman's lawyer repeated his contention Wednesday that the \nprominent San Diego businessman's right to a fair trial has been jeopardized \nand said he would oppose prosecutors' request to revoke Silberman's $500,000 \nbail. \n\n\nBut lawyer James Brosnahan said the \"first priority\" is to make sure that \nSilberman, who disappeared for two days last week just two months before he was \ndue to stand trial on federal money-laundering charges, gets appropriate \nprofessional care. \n\n\n\"I know the world sometimes likes to be cynical,\" Brosnahan said in a phone \ncall from his San Francisco office. \"But the first priority is to make sure \nthat Mr. Silberman is supported professionally and taken care of, as those \nneeds exist.\" \n\n\nBrosnahan did not elaborate on what sorts of professional attention -- medical \nor psychiatric -- might benefit Silberman, or where Silberman has been since \nleaving a Las Vegas hospital Monday. \"Under the circumstances, he's getting \nalong OK,\" Brosnahan said. \"And he's, I think, he's improving. That's good.\" \n\n\nThe lawyer declined to comment on any non-legal issue relating to the \ndisappearance, saying Silberman's family would release a statement today \ndetailing \"more information about what the situation is and so forth.\" \n\n\nSilberman, who was a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., was found \nunconscious in a Las Vegas hotel room Saturday -- two days after he abruptly \nvanished from San Diego -- in what prosecutors have called an apparent suicide \nattempt. Silberman, due to stand trial April 10, had swallowed an unknown \nnumber of prescription pills, Brosnahan has said. \n\n\nSilberman, reputed mobster Chris Petti and three others are accused of \nlaundering $300,000 given them by an undercover FBI agent who had characterized \nit as proceeds from a Colombian drug dealer. An FBI report released Friday, the \nday after Silberman was reported missing, alleges that Silberman confessed to \nthe money-laundering scheme. \n\n\nIn legal papers filed Tuesday, prosecutors claimed Silberman's disappearance \nraised the possibility that he would vanish again, this time to evade trial. \nBut Brosnahan said Wednesday that he would contend in a legal brief he planned \nto file today that there is \"no basis\" to revoke Silberman's bail. \n\n\nThough Silberman did go to Las Vegas after telling his family he was heading to \nOrange County for a meeting, he \"was entitled to travel in the United States\" \nand the request to revoke bail is \"not a serious\" one, Brosnahan said. \n\n\nProsecutors also said Silberman's departure raised so many questions about \nSilberman's mental state that he should be forced to see a psychiatrist to \nlearn if he is still mentally competent to stand trial. \n\n\nBut Brosnahan said Wednesday that might not be necessary. The papers he planned \nto file today would make it clear that \"we'll be able to deal with that in such \na way that won't become a big problem for anybody.\" He declined to elaborate. \n\n\nAssistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr. also said Tuesday that it was \n\"outrageous\" for Brosnahan to have contended from Las Vegas over the weekend \nthat Silberman could not receive a fair trial before U.S. District Judge J. \nLawrence Irving, who is presiding over the money-laundering case. \n\n\nIn an opinion issued last week rejecting a defense request to block the \nintroduction at the trial of FBI testimony about comments Silberman made to \nseveral agents upon arrest last April, Irving characterized those comments as \n\"self-incriminating.\" \n\n\n\"My only position with regard to that, and it's one I'm not going to change, is \nthat reference should not be made,\" Brosnahan said. \"And, in fact, it should be \nstricken from his opinion. Whether (Irving) will do that or not, I don't know. \nAn accurate contention would describe it as the contention of FBI agents. \nThat's all it is.\" \n\n\nIrving's comment convinced Silberman that the judge had overstepped his \nauthority and could not be fair, prompting Silberman's disappearance, Brosnahan \nsaid Sunday in Las Vegas. \n\n\nIrving also ordered the release of the FBI report detailing the alleged \nconfession after finding that disclosure would not jeopardize Silberman's \nability to receive a fair trial. A federal appellate court affirmed that \nruling. \n\n\nHowever, Brosnahan said, the subsequent \"barrage of released information is not \nconducive to a fair trial. Various materials have come out in connection with \nvarious rulings and all that, but the effect of all that is it threatens a fair \ntrial. It makes a fair trial difficult.\" \n\n\n\"There should be jurors who are willing to say to themselves, 'Richard \nSilberman might well be innocent.'

Because he is innocent,\" Brosnahan said."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0047", "docId": "179641", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition", "section": "Metro; Part B; Page 3; Column 6", "length": "2445", "headline": "LANDFILL FIRM HELPED FUND CITY, COUNTY CAMPAIGNS", "byline": "By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": "Table, CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS, Los Angeles Times", "text": "Browning-Ferris Industries, which is seeking approval to expand its Sunshine \nCanyon Landfill above Granada Hills to allow dumping there for another 50 \nyears, has contributed more than $100,000 since 1985 to campaign committees of \nthe Los Angeles County supervisors, City Council and mayor, a Times review of \ncampaign records shows. \n\n\nIn addition to the $106,212 donated by the waste disposal company, law firms, \nlobbyists and consultants working for BFI gave an additional $193,610 to the \nelected officials -- for a total of $299,822 from 1985 through 1989. \n\n\nBFI's lawyers and consultants have other clients with business before the city \nand county, so their donations aren't connected solely with the Sunshine Canyon \nexpansion. Even so, the nearly $300,000 given by BFI and the others represents \nliterally hundreds of separate contributions by more than a dozen firms \npromoting expansion of the Sunshine dump. \n\n\nIn addition, during 1989, BFI consultants organized small, private fund-raising \nbreakfasts and dinners for four City Council members, each of whom received \ncampaign contributions from seven to 10 members of the BFI team. \n\n\n\"They've been throwing a lot of money around,\" said Mary Edwards of the North \nValley Coalition, a homeowner group that has fought expansion of the dump. \"It \nseems every place we go\" at City Hall, BFI has \"been there first with money,\" \nshe said. \n\n\nBFI has a vast stake in the proposed expansion, which could generate billions \nof dollars in revenue for the firm over the next half-century. The expansion \nhas been opposed by neighborhood groups, because it would destroy thousands of \ntrees and extend the life of a dump they say has created dust and blowing \ntrash. \n\n\nThe landfill operates within the city, but county and city approval are needed \nbecause BFI's property straddles the city-county boundary and the firm wants to \nexpand on both sides of the line. Some elected officials have said they support \nthe expansion because of dwindling space in existing landfills. \n\n\nThe county expansion is to be considered today by the Los Angeles County \nRegional Planning Commission and will be taken up later by the Board of \nSupervisors. \n\n\nThe leading recipient of BFI contributions has been County Supervisor Mike \nAntonovich, whose district encompasses the landfill. Antonovich received \n$21,250 from BFI, or one-fifth of all contributions from the waste disposal \nfirm and its officials. An aide said Antonovich's contributors \"are buying his \nprogram and philosophy of government, he is not buying theirs.\" \n\n\nSupervisor Pete Schabarum, whose district includes BFI's other big Los Angeles \nCounty dump, the Azusa Western Landfill, was the second leading beneficiary, \nreceiving $15,650 in contributions from BFI. Schabarum, whose district gets the \nbulk of the county's trash, has opposed expansion of the Azusa dump due to \nconcern about ground water pollution, while supporting landfill expansions in \nother areas, including Sunshine Canyon. \n\n\nCampaign contributions have \"nothing to do with how he . . . votes,\" said \nSchabarum senior deputy Judy Hammond. She said Schabarum has been a \"driving \nforce . . . to establish new landfills throughout L.A. County.\" \n\n\nSupervisor Deane Dana got $12,500 from BFI, and Mayor Tom Bradley, $6,262. \n\n\nBy contrast, City Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents Granada Hills and has \nopposed expansion of the dump, received no money from BFI. \n\n\nThe impact of contributions on specific decisions is a matter of debate. At a \nminimum, critics say, campaign giving builds good will, giving well-heeled \ncontributors a political advantage over ordinary citizens. Contributors and \nofficeholders generally say the impact is minimal, since a large contributor \nstill accounts for a tiny percentage of campaign receipts. \n\n\n\"There are only so many spots on an elected official's calendar,\" and campaign \ngiving merely assures access to decision-makers, said Mark Ryavec of Delphi \nAssociates, a BFI consultant. \n\n\nAnd with the existing dump at Sunshine Canyon \"hanging on by its fingernails,\" \nRyavec said, it is \"just ludicrous to suggest that Browning-Ferris . . . has \nany impact on what's occurred in the decision-making process.\" \n\n\nBFI has taken its lumps from neighborhood activists and Bernson, and its \ntreatment by the City Council has been mixed. Still, BFI won two key political \nvictories in 1989, a year of stepped-up campaign giving in which more than a \ndozen firms involved in the proposed expansion made campaign contributions. \n\n\nLast summer, the City Council granted BFI relief from a previous decision by \nzoning officials that would have virtually closed the dump at the end of 1989 \nbecause of zoning violations. The council instead gave BFI the right to \ncontinue using the current disposal area through June, 1990, by which time the \nfirm is supposed to be dumping in an area farther from nearby homes. The action \nfollowed a sophisticated phone bank and direct mail campaign in support of the \nlandfill. \n\n\nAnd of greater long-term importance for BFI, the supervisors and City Council \nendorsed the expansion in principle through language inserted in a \"memorandum \nof cooperation\" on development of a city-county landfill at nearby Elsmere \nCanyon. \n\n\nIn the memorandum, the city and county agreed not only to develop Elsmere but \nto work toward permitting expansion of Sunshine on both sides of the \ncity-county line that divides the BFI property. At the county's insistence, the \ncity agreed to a clause that could temporarily bar city trucks from the new \ncounty area of the dump if the city failed to approve expansion on its side of \nthe line. \n\n\nThe endorsement raised eyebrows among opponents because officials usually avoid \nendorsing controversial projects before public hearings and environmental \nreview. In the case of Sunshine Canyon, a public hearing on the proposed county \nexpansion had not been held, and the application for city-side expansion had \nnot even been filed. \n\n\nIn interviews since, county and city officials have said they are trying to \nhead off a \"trash crisis,\" rather than help BFI. \n\n\n\"It has nothing to do with running interference for BFI,\" said Dennis \nMorefield, an aide to Dana. \"It has strictly to do with the . . . need for \nadequate landfill capacity to serve Los Angeles County throughout for the next \nseveral decades.\" \n\n\nThe 230-acre landfill takes about 6,000 tons of trash per day, or nearly \none-seventh of the solid waste in Los Angeles County. Space is expected to be \nexhausted by September, 1991. If county and city expansions are approved, BFI \nwill be able to fill additional canyon areas with an additional 215 million \ntons of trash. \n\n\nDump fees are almost certain to rise, but if BFI continued to charge its \ndisposal rates of between $24 and $31 per ton, the 215 million tons translates \ninto more than $5 billion in revenue over the life of the dump. BFI has \ndeclined to provide a revenue estimate. \n\n\nOf the $106,212 contributed by BFI alone, $63,400 went to the five supervisors, \nand $42,812 to Mayor Tom Bradley and members of the City Council. Donations to \ncity officeholders included $7,500 to Citizens for a Livable Los Angeles, a \ncommittee controlled by Councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and Marvin Braude that \nfought Occidental Petroleum's plan to drill for oil in the Pacific Palisades. \n\n\nThe BFI team includes an array of influential law firms, lobbyists and land-use \nconsultants. The lawyers and law firms -- led by Latham & Watkins; Jones, \nDay, Reavis & Pogue; and Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker -- gave \n$135,002 to city and county officials from 1985 through 1989, with half of that \ncoming from Latham & Watkins. \n\n\nThe land-use and community relations consulting firm of Handelman & \nKatherman and its partners Ira Handelman and Rob Katherman gave $21,391. \n\n\nMaureen Kindel, former president of the city Board of Public Works and a key \nBradley fund-raiser, is one of BFI's lobbyists. Kindel and others at her firm, \nRose & Kindel Inc., contributed $14,125. \n\n\nOther contributors included Ryavec and Delphi Associates, $6,722, and political \nconsultant Lynn Wessell, $4,600. \n\n\nThese firms have been political fixtures, with long-standing relationships with \nsupervisors and council members that predate the proposed dump expansion. \n\n\nBut other contributors in the BFI group got into the act last year as the \nproject approached a critical stage. \n\n\nBFI's geotechnical consultant, Purcell, Rhoades & Associates, which is \nbased in Hayward in Northern California, had not contributed before last year \nto Los Angeles officeholders, a review of campaign records shows. \n\n\nBut in 1989, Purcell, Rhoades made seven contributions totaling $3,500. \nAntonovich and Supervisor Deane Dana each got $1,000, and five council members \ngot $500 apiece -- the most a single contributor can give in county and city \nelections. \n\n\nSimilarly, Irvine-based Ultrasystems Engineers, which prepared the \nenvironmental impact report on the proposed dump expansion, before last year \nhad made a single contribution of $200 to a council member, campaign reports \nshow. But in 1989, Ultrasystems donated $2,500 -- $1,000 to Dana, $500 to \nAntonovich, $500 to Supervisor Ed Edelman, and $500 to Councilman Michael Woo. \n\n\n\"I don't think it affects the outcome of what happens in any respect,\" said H. \nRandall Stoke of Latham & Watkins, a lobbyist for BFI, referring to \ncampaign giving. \n\n\nStoke said he did not know if it would hurt not to give, but added, \"I'm scared \nto find out.\" \n\n\nOne BFI consultant, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said \ncampaign giving \"is the only way you can do business in this town.\" Another \nsaid council members all \"have their hand out at one time or another . . . , so \nyou give . . . and remain their friend, it's as simple as that.\" \n\n\nBut the BFI team last year did more than just respond to appeals for money. It \nalso put together small fund-raisers for council members. \n\n\nLast Feb. 24, for example, Ryavec organized a fund-raising breakfast for Woo at \nwhich Woo raised $3,250 from seven contributors involved with the Sunshine \nCanyon project. Six separate contributors -- BFI; BFI Vice President Michael \nLawlor; Delphi Associates; Ultrasystems; Purcell, Rhoades; and Paul, Hastings \n-- gave the legal maximum of $500, and Stoke of Latham & Watkins gave $250. \nMaureen Kindel also gave Woo $500 three days earlier, according to campaign \nrecords. \n\n\nLast March 23, Handelman & Katherman organized a fund-raising breakfast for \nYaroslavsky that brought eight contributions totaling $4,000 from BFI; \nHandelman & Katherman; Delphi Associates; Jones, Day; Purcell, Rhoades; and \nPaul, Hastings. Later last spring was when BFI donated the $7,500 to Citizens \nfor a Livable Los Angeles, the Yaroslavsky-Braude committee fighting oil \ndevelopment in the Pacific Palisades. A BFI official said the contribution was \nmade at the suggestion of Ryavec, who was active in the anti-oil fight. \n\n\nLast April 4, Ryavec organized a dinner for Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores that \nbrought nine contributions totaling $4,000 from BFI; Ryavec; Rose & Kindel; \nHandelman & Katherman; Paul, Hastings; Jones, Day; and Purcell, Rhoades. \n\n\nAnd on Dec. 20, Kindel put together a fund-raising breakfast for Councilman \nRichard Alatorre that brought in $5,000 -- 10 donations of $500 each from the \nBFI team. Even BFI's consulting forester, Ralph Osterling Consultants Inc. of \nSan Mateo, chipped in $500.

So Smith agreed to undergo a riskier procedure, \nknown as an autologous transplant, using his own marrow. \n\n\nBut just hours before he was scheduled to begin preparatory chemotherapy \ntreatment, Smith said, his doctors informed him that a potential donor had been \nidentified. \n\n\nSmith's doctors at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle were reluctant \nto postpone the scheduled transplant. It would take weeks to complete the tests \nto confirm that the donor was a perfect match. By that time, it might be too \nlate to perform the autologous transplant if the donor's marrow was \nincompatible. \n\n\nBut Smith opted to take the risk. Wednesday, he learned the gamble had paid \noff: the potential donor is indeed a match and Smith is scheduled to have a \ntransplant next week. \n\n\n\"I talked them into it,\" Smith said by phone from a sterile, enclosed hospital \nroom where he awaits the transplant. \n\n\n\"They felt I didn't have the time to wait, but I thought that if there is a \ndonor out there, after all we have done to find one, I wanted to have the \ntransplant,\" he said. \n\n\nAfter learning in November that Smith needed a bone marrow transplant, his \nrelatives in Los Angeles and New York launched major drives to find a donor. He \nsaid they raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay for more than 2,000 \npeople to be tested, and held more than a dozen testing sessions on both \ncoasts. \n\n\nOn Dec. 18, Smith appeared on a nationally televised talk show and appealed to \nviewers to take the test to become bone marrow donors. Thousands responded, and \nmatches were found for several other leukemia patients. \n\n\nSmith's family members said they were thrilled Sunday, but Smith said he still \nhas a hard battle ahead of him. \n\n\nThe donor -- who remains unknown to Smith and his family -- cannot undergo the \n30-minute marrow extraction procedure until next week. Smith said that he does \nnot know the reason for the delay -- and under the rules of the medical \nexchange, he is not allowed to contact the donor -- but his condition is \ndeteriorating. \n\n\nSmith said his doctors estimate he has about a 75% chance of recovery if he \nsurvives the transplant. The odds of that, he said, are about 50%. \n\n\nStill, he said, he has beaten the odds once -- finding a donor -- and he is \ndetermined to prevail over the cancer threatening him. \n\n\n\"I have three little boys and I want to make it,\" he said. The last-minute \nmatch, he said, has bolstered his hopes. \n\n\n\"My chances have been increased tremendously by really what is a miracle,\" he \nsaid. \"If I had come here one day earlier, I would have already started the \nchemotherapy for the autologous transplant and that would have been it.\" \n\n\n\"It is almost like it is meant to be that I pull this one out,\" he said. \n\n\n\"I am scared to death, but the bottom line is that I am still here and still \nfighting.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0049", "docId": "179643", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition", "section": "Metro; Part B; Page 3; Column 1", "length": "379", "headline": "MAIL CARRIER CONVICTED OF KILLING DOG", "byline": "By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "A Pacoima postman was convicted Wednesday of cruelty to animals for shooting a \ndog to death while delivering mail on his Arleta route in December, saying the \ndog had bitten him earlier. \n\n\nFloyd Bertran Sterling, 34, pleaded no contest to the felony charge in San \nFernando Municipal Court after the Los Angeles County district attorney's \noffice agreed to drop felony charges of carrying a concealed weapon and using a \nfirearm in a grossly negligent manner, Deputy Dist.

It is one of several setbacks the group has experienced recently. \n\n\nEarlier this month, the city ordered the coalition to leave Plummer Park by \nMarch 6 after neighborhood complaints that the nightly feeding program was \nattracting crime and creating sanitation problems. \n\n\nAnd last week, a major food source of the coalition's dried up when Drexel \nBurnham Lambert closed its doors for good.

Necropsies performed on two birds that died at the zoo during that \ntime also indicate that cold was a factor, he said, adding that similar deaths \nare likely to follow. \n\n\n\"If the weather holds as cold and wet, we'll expect more marginal animals to \nsuccumb,\" Jouett said. \n\n\nThe number of deaths does not appear \"abnormal\" considering the below-average \ntemperatures, he said. \"Each one of them is a regrettable loss, but it's \nsomething that we take precautions for, and there's nothing we can do.\" \n\n\nDuring the past week and a half, as San Diegans have braced for cold weather \nand high winds by turning up their heaters, zoo staff members have given \nanimals some extra warmth as well, Jouett said. As temperatures in San Diego \nand Escondido dipped into the 30s and below, heat lamps and other sources of \nwarmth have been provided in most zoo and park enclosures, he said. \n\n\n\"We take extra precautions,\" he said. \"We put up plastic sheets where necessary \nto act as windbreaks, provide extra straw to floors and nest boxes, leave doors \nopen to allow inside access if that's an option.\" \n\n\nStill, Jouett said, \"sometimes the weather is the last straw for some of these \nanimals that are sick or injured.\" \n\n\nThe recent spate of deaths is not the first related to cold this year. Since \nthe beginning of 1990, necropsy reports list hypothermia as a factor in 28 \nanimal deaths -- 18 in January and 10 so far in February, Jouett said. \n\n\nSince Feb. 12, pathologists have listed the weather as a factor in the deaths \nof a Costa Rican banded barbed-throat hummingbird, a lesser flamingo, an \nAfrican sunbird, a painted stork, an African oriole, a pygmy goose, a bird of \nparadise and a Malayan sambar antelope. \n\n\nIn most of the bird deaths, Jouett said, malnutrition or other ailments \ncontributed. The newborn antelope died of maternal neglect complicated by the \ncold, he said. It was on exhibit in a field at the Wild Animal Park where there \nwas no artificial heat source. The rest of the animals probably had access to \n\"at least a heat lamp -- and some had nesting boxes,\" Jouett said. \n\n\nHeat lamps, which consist of a bare bulb with a metal shade, have prompted \ncriticism from some animal keepers at the zoo, who say animals often burn \nthemselves as they attempt to get warm. \n\n\nCarmi G. Penny, curator of mammals at the zoo, acknowledged that some animals \nhave been burned as they huddle near the lamps. \n\n\n\"That has happened,\" he said in a recent interview. \"That's why we prefer not \nto use heat lamps. I do not like heat lamps.\" \n\n\nPart of the problem, he said, is that some keepers have placed heat lamps too \nclose to the cages. \n\n\n\"You have to know how to use them,\" he said. \"You can burn yourself with an \nelectric blanket if you're not careful.\" \n\n\nStill, he said, the lamps have been standard equipment at the zoo for so long \nthat it will take time and money to replace them all."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0054", "docId": "179654", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition", "section": "Metro; Part B; Page 4; Column 2; Metro Desk", "length": "309", "headline": "TWO SMASH WINDOW, FLEE JUVENILE HALL", "byline": "By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "Two teen-agers used a cot as a battering ram to break a window pane and escape \nfrom San Diego County Juvenile Hall on Tuesday, officials said. \n\n\nThe youths -- a 15-year-old federal detainee and a 17-year-old accused of \nmurder -- broke out five minutes after probation officers had routinely checked \nthe room they shared, said Jim Poe, deputy chief probation officer of juvenile \ninstitutions. \n\n\nThe 15-year-old is charged with smuggling people across the border, a U.S. \nmarshal said. The 17-year-old was arrested in the Feb. 16 fatal shooting of a \n35-year-old man at a Logan Heights duplex, said Carlos Armour, chief of the \njuvenile division of the district attorney's office.

HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "Despite law-enforcement officials' objections to private work-furlough jails, \nSan Diego judges will continue to consider placing criminals in the facilities \non a case-by-case basis, a local judicial panel has decided. \n\n\nIn a letter sent Tuesday to San Diego Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller Jr., Presiding \nSuperior Court Judge Judith McConnell said that local judges will continue to \nuse their discretion in deciding whether to place people convicted of a crime \nin a normal county jail or in a private work-furlough facility. \n\n\nTwo weeks ago, Miller had written to local judges opposing the commitment of \nany criminal defendants to private work-furlough facilities, which are seen by \nsupporters as a cost-effective way of alleviating the County Jail crowding. \nMiller's letter stemmed from an opinion issued in January by Atty. Gen. John \nVan de Kamp stating that assigning a person convicted of a crime to any private \njail operating without a county contract violates state penal codes. \n\n\nSome local judges, however, have said they believe that Van de Kamp's opinion \nleaves room for interpretation, a position apparent in McConnell's one-page \nletter to Miller. \n\n\n\"After additional research and full discussion, we have determined the issue of \nplacement of a person convicted of a crime in a private work-furlough facility \nmust be decided by each judge on a case-by-case basis,\" McConnell wrote. \n\n\nThe judges' decision to retain private jails as a sentencing options was made \nby the Superior Court judges' Executive Committee, a panel that reviews issues \nrelating to court operations. \n\n\nAdvocates insist that private work-furlough facilities, which inmates can leave \nonly to work and pay a daily fee, are suited for minor offenders, allowing the \ncounty's scarce jail space to be taken up by the hard-core criminal population. \nBased on county figures showing that it costs taxpayers $40 a day to house \ninmates in county jails, the nearly 250 local private work-furlough beds could \nsave the county about $4 million annually, according to operators of the \nprivate detention facilities. \n\n\nBut skeptics complain of inadequate supervision at some private facilities, \nciting past reports of drug use and of guards showing favoritism toward \ninmates. Some private facilities also occasionally failed to meet basic safety \nand sanitation standards. \n\n\nSpurred by those concerns, the state Board of Corrections asked the attorney \ngeneral's office to determine whether courts have the authority to direct \npeople convicted of crimes to a private facility that operates without a county \ncontract. In his opinion, Van de Kamp said the courts lack such authority. \n\n\nCounty officials have resisted awarding contracts to private work-furlough \nfacilities on the grounds that such pacts would make the county liable for any \nimproprieties that occur. \n\n\nAlthough Miller had not yet seen McConnell's letter Wednesday, district \nattorney's spokesman Steve Casey said that Miller is disappointed with the \njudges' decision \"because he believes the attorney general's opinion is pretty \nclear.\" \n\n\nSome judges, however, have said that, although Van de Kamp's opinion appears to \nrule out sending individuals to private work-furlough centers in cases with a \nminimum mandatory period of custody, they believe that they can still choose to \nuse the private jails in instances in which a judge has the discretion of \neither incarcerating or placing a defendant on probation. \n\n\n\"We don't see it that way and will continue to oppose committing (inmates) \nthere,\" Casey said. \"But, as to the disposition of each case, the judges will \nget to decide that.

Last Saturday, The Times reported that such a plan was being \nprepared for the site. \n\n\nThe plan was described as moronic by Bernson, who called the reservoir \"one of \nthe most ecologically sensitive areas in the city of Los Angeles.\" \n\n\nBut Gastelum said Wednesday that his idea was to build 500 homes for faculty -- \nover 10 years -- on 156 acres of the reservoir, which is owned by the city's \nDepartment of Water and Power. \"Ninety-five percent of the property would've \nbeen open space. The parcels I was looking at surrounded the reservoir,\" he \nsaid. \n\n\nThe idea was to offer low- to moderate-priced housing for sale to teachers as \nan incentive for them to move to Los Angeles. The idea of using housing as a \nlure is still being explored by Gastelum. \n\n\nGastelum said the parcels he was reviewing for development lie outside the \nactual reservoir, which is bounded by a concrete embankment. \n\n\nGastelum, who also is Bradley's liaison to the DWP, said the reservoir is \ngrossly under-utilized. \"DWP has an asset there that's not doing anything. We \nshouldn't leave it the way it is,\" he said. \"It's costing $100,000 a year just \nto cut the weeds there. It doesn't make sense.\" \n\n\nThe property now sits idle. Trespassing is forbidden. At the very least, hikers \nand naturalists should be able to trek through the area, Gastelum said. Very \ninfrequently naturalist groups are permitted to enter the property, for \nexample, to count the migrating Canada geese that use a pond at the north end \nof the property, DWP officials said. \n\n\nThe reservoir, built in the 1930s primarily to provide irrigation water for \norchards and farms in the West Valley, was drained in 1969 to prepare it for \nimprovements. It has been empty ever since. In the early 1970s plans to restore \nthe reservoir were dropped due to the high cost of complying with new state \nlaws about the earthquake safety of dams, such as the one at the reservoir. \n\n\nAs recently as March, 1988, DWP was exploring possible sale of portions of the \nproperty. In a March, 1988, letter DWP real estate executives objected to a \nproposal to zone the property for agricultural use on the grounds that such a \nrestrictive designation would hurt the property's value, as DWP contemplated \nselling \"substantial portions\" of the reservoir. \n\n\nBut DWP now has no plans to dispose of any part of the property, said Ted \nMcGillis, DWP assistant chief real estate officer. Its current status will \ncontinue until the agency gets other directions from the district's councilman, \nthe mayor and the DWP board, said Ed Freudenberg, DWP press secretary. \n\n\nBradley's office tried Tuesday to defuse the controversy stirred up by last \nweekend's accounts of the faculty housing plan.

Knight suffered a broken \npelvis, broken ribs and cuts. \n\n\n\"The reports make it sound like she was really in the wrong and that she could \nsee the train and that she didn't stop,\" said Fred Stowers, cousin to Patricia \nand Demonte. \"I refuse to believe that she was trying to outrun the train.\" \n\n\nRelatives said Knight drove carefully and always wore a seat belt. \n\n\nKnight had graduated from Morningside High School in Inglewood.

Loughran \nsaid in an interview. \"They are martyrs.\" \n\n\nHe said the killings touched the lives of many on his campus and led to the \ncancellation of all classes and an unusual day devoted to large assemblies and \nsmall discussion sessions on all aspects of the Central American conflict. \n\n\n\"This is a big day,\" Loughran said in opening the teach-in. \"May our minds and \nhearts open up.\" \n\n\nA spirited but civil discussion followed about the causes and potential \nsolutions to the 10-year-old civil war in El Salvador. \n\n\nErnesto Rivas-Gallont, former Salvadoran ambassador to the United States, told \nthe audience of more than 800 students and faculty that deep political, social, \neconomic, ideological and cultural conflicts that led to the civil war will not \nbe solved without outside mediation. \n\n\n\"It's been 10 years now that the country has been bleeding to death,\" he said. \n\"It's about time it stops.\" \n\n\nRivas-Gallont and Father Cesar Jerez, president of the University of Central \nAmerica campus in Managua, Nicaragua, differed on what needs to occur to bring \npeace to El Salvador. \n\n\nRivas-Gallont said the United States is an \"important player\" and must continue \nto assist Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani in efforts to strengthen \ndemocracy by continuing to provide economic aid, including more financial \nassistance to labor unions in El Salvador. \n\n\nThe United States can do more by supporting the peace process than aiding the \nwar, he said. \n\n\nBut Jerez singled out the Bush Administration as part of the problem. \"The \nsmall countries of Central America have been considered by Washington for years \nas the back yard of your country,\" he told the audience. \n\n\n\"Central America under the Bush Administration is part of a Cold War\" that pits \nEast against West. \n\n\nHe suggested that the United Nations, the Organization of American States and \nthe Catholic Church must mediate the battle between leftist and rightist forces \nin El Salvador and elsewhere in Central America. \n\n\nJerez said he has told members of Congress that the United States must stop \nmilitary and economic aid to the government of El Salvador \"if it is clear that \nthey are violating human rights.\" \n\n\nIf the United States does not stop aid to El Salvador, Jerez urged that it be \nconditioned on establishment of a dialogue between the warring factions -- the \ngovernment, the army and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). \n\n\nBoth agreed that the slayings of the Jesuits, their cook and her teen-age \ndaughter were, as Rivas-Gallont put it, \"abhorrent, heinous murders\" and that \nthe perpetrators must be brought to justice. \n\n\nThe director of El Salvador's military academy and eight other members of the \nSalvadoran army have been charged with premeditated murder in the assassination \nof the priests. \n\n\nAmong those killed was the university rector, Ignacio Ellacuria and Vice Rector \nIgnacio Martin-Baro. All the priests were leftist intellectuals and advocates \nof negotiations between the U.S.-backed government and the Marxist liberation \nfront. \n\n\n\"I hope the deaths of the brothers will stop what is going on,\" Jerez said. But \nhe urged the audience to consider the U.S. role in fabricating the \"bullets \nthat killed the Jesuits in El Salvador,\" in the invasion of Panama and support \nfor the Nicaraguan Contras. \n\n\nLoughran said in an interview later that it is hoped the death of the Jesuits \nwill lead to democratic reforms in El Salvador. \"If we can force an honest \ninvestigation and have a fair trial and bring people to justice, that would be \na crack in a whole bad situation,\" he said. \n\n\nLoyola student Martha Arevalo, who came to Los Angeles from El Salvador, \npraised the university for holding the teach-in, which she said was long \noverdue. \"If people here in the U.S. can understand and be educated about the \nsituation in El Salvador,\" she said, \"something could be done to stop the \nthousands of people who are dying and the whole war itself.\" \n\n\nSara Martinez, a panelist who fled the war in El Salvador, expressed the hope \nthat events like the teach-in will increase American understanding of the \nproblems in her native country and help end the civil war there.

He chose Bernie James and Mike Sweeney of \nthe Cleveland Crunch, who, as Socker captain Brian Quinn might have said, will \nnever be confused with finesse players. They like to push people around. \n\n\nBut seriously, a team with an offense of Tatu, Preki and Branko Segota is hard \nto stop and even harder to top. \n\n\nSo for Cooper it was just another loss to fellow Englishman Ron Newman, the \ncoach of the West who brought Cooper to this country Feb. 19, 1970 to play for \nhis Dallas Tornados. Cooper is now 0-3 against Newman in MISL All-Star games \nand 0-3 against him in MISL championship series. \n\n\n\"I can't take credit for that,\" said Newman of his most-recent victory over \nCooper. \"That's the players. We had so much power.\" \n\n\nAnyway, who says this team from the West can't play a little defense, too? \nKevin Crow of the Sockers has been defender of the year for two seasons \nrunning. And Dallas' Doc Lawson isn't too bad. He made a bicycle kick in front \nof the West goal to prevent danger midway through the fourth quarter when the \nEast was closing in. \n\n\nPerhaps most amazing was Krys Sobieski, the West's 39-year-old goalie, who \npicked up the victory. He made 10 saves, many of them while diving like a kid \non the beach. \n\n\nTwo of the East's four goals were on shootouts. When all was said and kicked, \nthe West was just too good. \n\n\nA chronological look at how the West won: \n\n\n -- 7:10 p.m. The players exit the field following warmups. Kids jam against \nthe guard rails that separate players from fans and scream for autographs. Most \nplayers wave and run past. A few stop, sign a program or two and head for the \nlocker room. \n\n\n -- 7:38. The lights dim. Limos carrying the players roll onto the carpet and \nthe introductions begin. \n\n\n -- 7:50. The introductions hit a snag as one of the limos has trouble exiting \nthe carpet. After nearly hitting the wall twice and backing up, it finally \nmakes it. The fans applaud. \n\n\n -- 7:58. Kickoff. Front line for the West is Segota, Tatu and Preki, otherwise \nknows as a goalie's basic nightmare. \n\n\n -- 8:02. Socker defender George Fernandez streaks down the left sidelines, \ntakes a pass from Tatu and sends it whistling into the upper right corner with \nhis left foot to put the West up 1-0 early in the first quarter. The shot \nlooked like a carbon copy of his goal in the Sockers' 6-4 victory over Tacoma \nSunday. Fernandez, making his first all-star appearance, was later chosen the \ngame's MVP. \n\n\n\"I never thought about being the MVP of the All-Star game,\" Fernandez said. \n\"Not in my wildest dreams. I just had a good game, just one of those things.\" \n\n\n -- 8:09. West defender Fernando Clavijo, a former Socker who plays for the St. \nLouis Storm, sends a 30-footer into the upper right corner with his left foot. \nWest 2, East 0. \n\n\n -- 8:14. Handball is called on West. Shootout awarded. Wichita's Chico Borja \ntakes it, swerves around West goalie Slobo Ilijevski and scores, making it 2-1. \nA few minutes later, Borja is called for tripping, giving the West a powerplay. \nApparently, Borja didn't think much of the call. He made a diving gesture with \nhis hands indicating he thought Clavijo took a dive. \n\n\n -- 8:28. Early second quarter. Preki, who has already missed an open shot and \nmuffed a pass, shows a dash of his usual magic, sending a 40-footer into the \ntop left corner with his left foot. \n\n\n -- 8:40. Socker midfielder Brian Quinn lets the referee know what he thinks of \nan illegal substitution call against the West. Hard to read lips, but it was \nsomething like \"Bull Stuff.\" \n\n\n -- 9:23. Early third quarter. East forward Dale Ervine (Wichita) knocks a pass \noff the boards with his heel. Defender Bruce Savage is waiting and heads it in. \nWest 3, East 2. \n\n\n -- 9:44. Forward Gary Heale (St. Louis) gives the West a bit of breathing room \nlate in the third quarter, sending in a right-footer at the goal mouth off a \npass from Fernandez. \n\n\n -- 9:45. The West rolls on. Segota picks up his second point of the evening, \ntaking a pass from fellow Yugoslavian and Socker teammate Zoran Karic and \nsending it in to the right corner. The fans go crazy. \n\n\n -- 9:51. Before the fourth quarter begins it is announced that Segota has won \nthe Super Skills competition, which started Tuesday night and was completed at \nhalftime. Segota is presented with a check for $2,500. That's a good chunk of \nchange for an MISL player. \n\n\n -- 10:01. Forward Dale Mitchell (Kansas City) scores the East's second \nshootout goal, cutting the West's lead to 5-3. \n\n\n -- 10:19. East midfielder Carl Valentine (Baltimore) scores with 55 seconds \nremaining to give the West a scare. \n\n\n -- 10:21. The scare and the game ends with East forward Jan Goossens (Kansas \nCity) hitting the crossbar as time runs out. Another MISL All-Star Game come \nand gone. \n\n\nSocker Notes \n\n\nSocker owner Ron Fowler said Wednesday that the Sockers have ended trade \nnegotiations with the Tacoma Stars, who have been attempting to trade Dave \nHoggan, a midfielder given a 30-day suspension earlier this month by Star Coach \nKeith Weller. \"There were too many uncertainties in the proposal,\" Fowler said."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0064", "docId": "179682", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition", "section": "Sports; Part C; Page 1; Column 6; Sports Desk", "length": "791", "headline": "CHARGERS LOSE PICK TO RAIDERS", "byline": "By CURT HOLBREICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "Three free-agent players arrived and kicker Chris Bahr left Wednesday as the \nChargers continued to rebuild under new General Manager Bobby Beathard, but the \nmajor news was the future player the Chargers will never get. \n\n\nThe club has been informed by the NFL office that it owes the Raiders a \nfourth-round draft choice as part of a complicated 1988 trade that sent \noffensive tackle Jim Lachey to the Raiders and brought the Chargers offensive \ntackle John Clay and running back Napoleon McCallum. \n\n\nThe announcement is the latest bad twist for the Chargers in a trade that is \none of the blackest marks on the three-year tenure of Beathard's predecessor, \nSteve Ortmayer. \n\n\nClay's career as a Charger was ended by a neck injury early in the 1988 season. \nMcCallum has never played a down for the Chargers and is on the team's \nmilitary/reserve list while serving as a Naval recruiting officer in San Diego. \n\n\nThe Chargers had sent a 1989 third- and a 1990 fourth-round choice to the \nRaiders when they acquired McCallum in October 1988. Those choices had been \ntraded to the Chargers by the Raiders as part of the first half of the deal \nthat sent Lachey to the Raiders and Clay to the Chargers in July 1988. Lachey \nwas later traded by the Raiders to Washington for quarterback Jay Schroeder. \n\n\nNow the league has informed Beathard the deal also included a provision that \nthe Chargers would send their 1990 fourth-round pick to the Raiders if McCallum \nwas with the team in 1989. The Chargers were told that although McCallum did \nnot play in the regular season he reported for training camp and that was all \nthat was required. \n\n\nThe loss of the fourth-round pick means the Chargers have 12 selections in the \nApril 22-23 draft but only three in the first five rounds. The Chargers have \nthe fifth pick of the first round and two choices in the third round, theirs \nand that of Indianapolis. The Indianapolis selection was acquired in the trade \nthat sent linebacker Chip Banks to the Colts. \n\n\nThat pick was upgraded from a fourth-round choice when the Colts included Banks \non their 37-man protected list in the Plan B free-agent program. \n\n\nThe Chargers also announced their first signing of a Plan B player and the \ndecision to not invite one of their own back. It could signal the start of a \nbusy final 5 1/2 weeks before the plan's April 1 signing deadline. \n\n\nBruce Plummer, a 6-foot-1, 203-pound safety from Indianapolis, signed a \ntwo-year contract, said his agent, Neil Allen. \n\n\nAllen said the contract was for more than $600,000 and included a \"high \nfive-figure\" signing bonus. \n\n\nPlummer, 25, came to the Colts from Miami last season in the first year of the \nPlan B program. He was used primarily on special teams by the Colts and played \nin all 16 games, starting two. He joined the NFL out of Mississippi State in \n1986 as a ninth-round draft pick by Denver. He played in 22 games for the \nBroncos before being claimed on waviers by Miami late in the 1988 season. \n\n\nThe Chargers also said that Bahr would not return as their kicker. Bahr, 37, \nwho was signed by the Chargers from the Raiders in last year's Plan B program, \nhad been one of 17 players left unprotected by the team. \n\n\nBahr made 17 of 25 field goal attempts, including a 45-yarder on the final play \nto defeat Denver, 19-16, in the season finale. The decision leaves the Chargers \nwithout a kicker on their roster. \n\n\nThe Chargers also announced the signing of free agent cornerbacks Joe Fuller \nand Tim Jackson. Both were on developmental squads last season and were not \npart of the Plan B program. \n\n\nFuller, 25, spent the first five weeks of last season on the Minnesota \ndevelopmental squad before he was dropped because of a back injury. He was \nsigned by the Vikings as a free agent in 1989 after three seasons (1986-88) \nwith Saskatchewan of the Canadian Football League. Fuller, 5-11, 180, played \nhis college football at Northern Iowa. \n\n\nJackson, 24, was a 1989 ninth-round draft pick by Dallas from Nebraska. \nJackson, 5-11, 192, spent four weeks on the Dallas developmental squad before \nhe was released and signed by Washington for its developmental squad for the \nfinal month of the season. \n\n\nCharger Notes \n\n\nThe Chargers have an interest in several more Plan B players, according to the \nplayers' agents. Among those are Chicago running back Thomas Sanders, \nWashington running back Joe Mickles, Washington offensive guard Ralph Tamm and \nMiami offensive guard Tom Toth. . . . Charger players left unprotected in Plan \nB that have drawn the attention of other teams, according to their agents, \ninclude quarterback David Archer (New Orleans and San Francisco), linebacker \nJoe Campbell (Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, the Raiders and Seattle) and \noffensive tackle Brett Miller (New York Jets)."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0065", "docId": "179683", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition", "section": "Sports; Part C; Page 11; Column 6", "length": "224", "headline": "CIF GIRLS ROUNDUP;", "byline": "By DENNIS KAISER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "The knights upset the Highlanders, the division's top-seeded team, in a girls \n4-A CIF quarterfinal game at La Habra on Wednesday night, 51-44. \n\n\nBishop Montgomery will face the winner of the Los Altos-West Torrance game in \nthe semifinals. \n\n\nThe Knights (17-9) first scented victory after a 15-2 spurt that gave them a \n17-10 lead with 4:59 remaining in the first quarter. \n\n\nBishop Montgomery shot just 22% (seven for 31) from the field in the first half \nbut still led at intermission, 21-20, taking advantage of 13 Highlander \nturnovers. \n\n\nLa Habra (21-4) held a decided height advantage over Bishop Montgomery but \ncouldn't get the ball inside to its 6-5 center, Zrinka Kristic, and two 6-1 \nforwards, Ana Kristic and Leslie Ferguson.

Occidental players had been victimized in much the \nsame way by Redlands fans two weeks earlier at Redlands. \n\n\nAppleton said that while he didn't condone the behavior, he tolerated it until \nOccidental supporters began using what Appleton described as \"a hammer\" to make \nmore noise. \n\n\n\"I leaned over to ask them to please do whatever they wanted but not to use \nthat (hammer) -- that I thought it was unsportsmanlike,\" Appleton recalled. \n\"Well, that wasn't appreciated.\" \n\n\nOccidental fans, whose team went on to lose, 88-83, reportedly created an ugly \nscene by hammering Appleton with abuse. \n\n\n\"I don't mean to lean on the Occidental men,\" Appleton said. \"It was an \nescalation of some bad sportsmanship that has been building. \n\n\n\"(Occidental President) John Slaughter and I talked the very next day and \nagreed that we both had some responsibility for taking a leadership role in \nstating what college athletics are all about. \n\n\n\"At the next game between our teams, we need to make sure that both \ninstitutions are exemplary in how we treat each other.\" \n\n\nBest of the West?: Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist likes to think of the Western \nState Conference as California junior college basketball's equivalent of the \nAtlantic Coast Conference or the Big East. \n\n\nThe comparison has some merit. \n\n\nSeven of the WSC's 11 teams are in the 26-team Southern California regional of \nthe state tournament, and three -- Valley, Ventura and Santa Monica -- are \namong the top 10 seeded teams. \n\n\nThe respect the seeding committee had for the WSC is evident in the seeding of \ntwo teams with similar records. Glendale (22-11), a WSC school, was tabbed \n11th, but Mt. San Jacinto (20-10) of the Orange Empire Conference was 18th. \n\n\nIn fact, probably only one other Southern California junior college conference \ncould claim to be stronger -- the WSC women. \n\n\nThe WSC women had the second-, fourth- and fifth-seeded teams, and a total of \nfour in the 16-team field of the Southern California regional. \n\n\nStepping forward: There are plenty of reasons for Cal State Northridge's \nmonthlong slide in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. men's basketball \nstandings, but Kendell McDaniels is not one of them. \n\n\nThe 6-foot-4 sophomore forward from Chatsworth High has been the Matadors' most \nconsistent player during the past month, in which Northridge has lost six of \neight games and fallen from first to fifth place in the CCAA standings. \n\n\nMcDaniels has been Northridge's leading scorer four times and its top rebounder \nin three games. He has shot 57.5% from the field and has averaged 14 points and \n7.4 rebounds a game. \n\n\n\"He's been playing very well both offensively and defensively,\" said Pete \nCassidy, CSUN's coach. \"Not only is he scoring, but he's also doing a good job \ninside underneath the boards.

But if they suffer a double-digit \nloss to the Antelopes, they probably would be seeded fifth and would play on \nthe road. \n\n\nA victory also would avenge an 82-81 loss to Grand Canyon in January and assure \nthe Mustangs (19-14) of a 20-win season. \n\n\nRatings game: The Cal Lutheran softball team is ranked ninth in the NAIA \npreseason poll, its highest preseason ranking ever.

Let's put our chips down. If we lose, we lose. If they \nwin, great, then they've got the experience of two highly competitive games \nbefore going to Italy. It's that type of do-or-die pressure they need before \nthey go to Italy.\" \n\n\nNewman allowed that the MISL side would stand little chance of winning. Indoor \nplayers, he said, simply are not in outdoor shape. \n\n\nThe national team is handicapped because there is no professional outdoor \nleague from which to draw players. But Newman said he thinks it is also \nhandicapped by the federation's unwillingness to use MISL players. \n\n\nNewman has never been asked to lend a player to the national team. \n\n\n\"The USSF people just think the indoor game deteriorates outdoor players,\" \nNewman said when asked why there hasn't been cooperation between the two \ngroups. \n\n\nFricker disagreed. \"We're very cooperative,\" he said. \n\n\nNewman said he and other MISL coaches would allow their players to compete on \nthe national team for a game or two. But the national team often competes in \nexhibitions around the country for up to two weeks at a time. \n\n\n\"We would give them a Kevin Crow if they had a game coming up this weekend,\" he \nsaid. \"But we wouldn't let our players go for two weeks.\" \n\n\nNewman admitted that using players from an indoor league isn't ideal when \npreparing for a World Cup. \n\n\nConditioning wouldn't be a problem for players who knew they would be called \nupon for national team duties, Newman said. \n\n\n\"If players knew they were going to play outdoors they could train for it,\" he \nsaid. \n\n\nEarl Forman, MISL Commissioner, announced Wednesday that a four-man committee \nhas been appointed to contact the USSF about Newman's challenge. \n\n\nThe committee consists of Roy Turner, Wichita Wings president; Gordan Jago, \nDallas sidekicks president; Kenny Cooper, Baltimore Blast coach; and Newman. \n\n\nSaid Foreman, \"We come in peace with an olive branch.\" \n\n\nBranko Segota scored one goal and assisted on another Wednesday to move past \nStan Stamenkovic as the second all-time All-Star scoring leader in league \nhistory with 16 points (eight goals and eight assists). \n\n\nHe also moved past Stamenkovic in assists (Stamenkovic has seven). \n\n\nSegota's goal came at 13:51 of the third quarter, only 21 seconds after St. \nLouis' Gary Heale had also scored for the West. They were the two quickest \ngoals scored by one team in the game's history. \n\n\nSegota's San Diego teammate, Steve Zungul, is the All-Star game leader in \npoints with 19. \n\n\nGeorge Fernandez, a San Diego defender also had a goal and an assist in the \ngame, his first All-Star performance. \n\n\nAt Tuesday's luncheon, East Coach Kenny Cooper asked why players had to be \nintroduced amid fog and emerging from rocket ships. \"Why not let the game stand \non its own?\" he asked. \n\n\nWell, the introductions went something like this: \n\n\nThe Sports Arena went dark, a Frankie Goes to Hollywood tune blasted through \nthe public address system, limousines drove out onto the carpet and coaches and \nplayers emerged into spotlights. \n\n\nThe Sockers might get some hate mail for breaking from tradition at the \nAll-Star game. \n\n\nWhen the team moved indoors in the early 1980s, then-owner Bob Bell replaced \nthe national anthem with \"God Bless America.\" Bell heard the Philadelphia 76ers \nhad done just that and went on a long home winning streak. \n\n\nWhen Ron Fowler took over before the 1987-88 season, however, he decided to go \nback to the national anthem. But fan complaints poured in and the new owner had \nto change his tune. \n\n\nBut Wednesday night, Michelle Lovett, lead singer from Dr. Feelgood and the \nInterns of Love, sang the national anthem.

He said San Diego was trying to counter the difference in \npotential ticket revenue by special fund-raising events and financial \nconcessions that could could improve the competitiveness of San Diego's bid. He \nalso said San Diego is emphasizing the advantages of the more compact nature of \nthe city compared to the size of the greater Los Angeles area. \n\n\nBut San Diego officials also expressed concern because the most recent of the \nfour Super Bowls played at the Rose Bowl was in 1987 so NFL officials might \nwant the game to return there before San Diego. \n\n\n\"We will have another Super Bowl in San Diego,\" McGrory said. \"The question is \nwhether we have that Super Bowl in 1993.\" \n\n\nIf the city fails to receive the 1993 game, its next opportunity to bid would \nbe for the 1995 game.

We have to be credible with \nour data background (in order to set policy and regulations.)\" \n\n\nThe secretary's announcement comes almost a year to the date when the Alar in \napples controversy ignited. The resulting fallout was devastating to apple \nproducers, who lost an estimated $250 million in the following months as sales \ndisappeared. \n\n\nProduce merchants were also hit hard when the alleged Chilean grape poisoning \noccurred just days after the Alar scare. The discovery of cyanide in two \nberries caused importers to lose about $100 million when all Chilean fresh \nproduce was banned from sale in this country. \n\n\nThe increased USDA pesticide testing will be used to help determine the actual \nhealth threat to the public from these residues in food. \n\n\n\"I don't believe the zero-risk standard has applicability in the real world,\" \nsaid Yeutter. \"To suggest that the risk (from farm chemicals) should be zero is \nnonsensical. We will, however, insist on very low or minimal risk to the \npublic.\" \n\n\nThe debate over allowable risk, or the permissible levels of chemical residues, \nis at the heart in the ongoing public and Congressional debate over pesticides. \nAt present, there is no encompassing standard for all agricultural chemicals. \nInstead, each compound has different acceptable residues for fresh foods, \nparticularly produce. \n\n\nYeutter said the Bush Administration is also proposing that the federal process \nfor canceling the use of a chemical -- such as Alar -- needs to be shortened \nfrom the present several-year time frame. \n\n\nAnother USDA proposal to cut pesticide usage comes in the form of encouraging \nfarmers to rotate crops more frequently from one growing season to another. \nCurrently, the federal farm program discourages such changes in the type of \ncommodities that are grown. \n\n\n\"We should be more flexible on crop rotations and maybe that will allow us to \nreduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers,\" Yeutter said. \n\n\nHowever, some in the audience were not cheered by Yeutter's comments. \n\n\nFor instance, one industry official said that the federal government has more \nthan enough data on pesticide residues to regulate the food industry and should \nnow begin to reassure the public that the use of these chemicals poses only a \nnegligible risk. \n\n\n\"Is it a good use of resources to expand our pesticide testing? No,\" said Jill \nSnowden, technical director for the Alexandria, Va.,-based United Fresh Fruit. \n\"We need to spend more on reassuring the public that the risk from these \ncompounds is slight.\" \n\n\nIn fact, another federal official present at the convention said that expanded \npesticide residue tests in food would produce no surprises on the exact levels \nof these chemicals in the food supply. \n\n\n\"The rate of residue violations in food would not increase -- plus or minus the \ncurrent margin of error -- if the number of tests were expanded,\" said Richard \nRonk, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \n\n\nRonk said that about 1% of the fresh produce tested by his agency was found to \nbe in violation of federal standards in 1988, or the last year for which \ncomplete data is available. \n\n\nOut of 15,000 samples of domestic and imported fruit and vegetables tested by \nFDA, 96% were found free of chemical residues. The remaining 3% were considered \nto be in technical violation, or showed traces of a specific compound present \nthat was not approved for use on that particular crop. \n\n\nA former high-ranking FDA official also doubted the benefit of expanded testing \nfor farm chemicals. \n\n\n\"When you talk about pesticide residues everyone is scared stiff,\" said Sanford \nMiller, dean of the University of Texas' Biomedical Sciences Graduate School in \nSan Antonio. \"But no one can offer the public absolute safety. We can only \noffer relative safety.\" \n\n\nA public relations consultant to the Center for Produce Quality, an industry \npromotional group, said that agriculture has had difficulty communicating with \nconsumers about pesticides. \n\n\n\"What needs to be said is that the 'health benefits of produce outweigh any \npossible pesticide risk,' \" said Rob Gould, with the firm of Potter-Novelli in \nWashington. \"We're for produce, not pesticides.

RICK CORRALES / Los Angeles Times", "text": "It sits along Atlantic Boulevard in an area where police say prostitutes ply \ntheir trade for anything from $40 to three cans of beer and a $15 IOU. \n\n\nThe Atlantis Motel consists of two stories of dirt-encrusted, broken-down rooms \nthat stink of frying grease. Most of the tenants have lived there for months, \nsometimes years, signing over their welfare checks to the manager to cover the \n$150 average weekly rate. \n\n\nMany are on drugs, police say. Almost all have small children who play in the \nparking lot and are sometimes spotted bathing in the swimming pool, which reeks \nof urine and too much chlorine. \n\n\nThe Atlantis has been around Cudahy for 25 years, and every year, according to \nresidents, business people and city officials, it becomes a bigger sore spot on \na busy street lined with some of the town's most established businesses. \nBusiness people say they can't remember a time when the Atlantis was a decent \nlow-budget motel where truckers or traveling businessmen, seeking clean rooms \nand color televisions, came for the night. Instead, they say, it is a place \nwhere drug deals are made from room windows and prostitutes hook with their \nchildren in tow. \n\n\n\"Our customers can't even walk down the street without being propositioned or \nasked if they want to buy drugs,\" said one businessman. \n\n\nThe Atlantis, acting City Manager Jack Joseph said, is nothing more than \"a \nblot on the city.\" \n\n\nArea business people and even some tenants say the only thing that will \nstraighten out the old motel is a bulldozer. \n\n\n\"This place is basically a dump,\" said one tenant. \"The best thing that could \nhappen would be to knock it down.\" \n\n\nOver the last few months the city, with help from the Los Angeles County \nSheriff's Department, has launched a feverish campaign to wipe the Atlantis \nMotel from Cudahy's streets. \n\n\nOfficials have tramped through the security gates innumerable times in the last \nfew months for building inspections, fire inspections and Health Department \ninspections. Cudahy building inspector Daniel Pulone said inspectors from his \noffice visit the Atlantis about twice a week, noting code violations. \n\n\nWith long lists of violations from the county Department of Health Services and \ncounty Fire Department, the city is building an arsenal of evidence it plans to \nuse to file suit against the owner in an effort to have the motel declared a \npublic nuisance and closed. The city recently changed the curb marking in front \nof the motel from a temporary no-parking zone to a no-parking zone in an \nadministrative attempt to stop drive-up drug transactions and prostitution. \n\n\nIf the paper work onslaught fails to shut or clean up the Atlantis, city \nofficials say they hope law enforcement will succeed. Sheriff's deputies have \nspent 263.3 hours in two months just responding to calls at the Atlantis Motel, \nLt. Dennis Dahlman said. Dahlman said 36 arrests for prostitution have been \nmade and there have been an unknown number of arrests for drugs. \n\n\n\"It's a major problem,\" Dahlman said. \"But we are not going to give up by any \nstretch of the imagination. We're going to keep pounding on them and pursue \nevery avenue to get it closed down.\" \n\n\nShutting the Atlantis Motel for good may not be easy, city officials said. \nAlthough the motel has a long history of violations, inspectors said, \nviolations are corrected within deadlines. \n\n\n\"They do just the minimum to keep us from shutting them down,\" Pulone said. \n\n\nIt has been a frustrating experience for city officials, who insist that the \nplace is nothing more than a haven for drug dealers, vandals and prostitutes. \nOne walk through the place, they say, tells the story. \n\n\nRoom 106 of the Atlantis Motel is the room inspector Pulone says is least \nlikely to win the Good Housekeeping award. The door has been broken off its \nhinges and rests precariously against the frame. Inside, a double bed with a \nstained mattress dominates the room. There is trash everywhere -- on the floor, \npiled on the kitchen table, crammed into cracks of ripped furniture. The \ncurtains are tattered and faded green. The carpet is brown. Everything is \ncovered with grime. \n\n\nThis is the room from which deputies say many of the drug sales occur. They \nhave arrested one of the women who lives there at least twice on suspicion of \npossessing and selling cocaine. Just last Wednesday, Patricia Hession, 31, was \narrested after a sheriff's deputy found a pipe he said was used to smoke \ncocaine in her room. \n\n\nUpstairs, in cramped Room 209, 19-year-old Becky Sanchez tries to clean up \nafter her two infant children. She lives in the $190-a-week room with her \nuncle, a friend and her children. She wants to get out, she said, but has to \nstay home with her children and can't save any money for first and last week \nrent deposit on an apartment. Her brother, she said, pays for everything. \n\n\nDown the hall, eight people live in Room 206. There are mattresses stacked \nagainst the wall in the bedroom and two cots in each corner of the bedroom. \nSisters Carol San, 25, and Marcy San, 19, say they live there because, like \nSanchez, they can't save the money to move out. \n\n\n\"We can't pay rent and save at the same time,\" Marcy San said. \n\n\nBoth say they hate being forced to live at the Atlantis because of its bad \nreputation, but they say: \"Not everybody that lives here does drugs. We don't \nmess with that stuff, but people think because we live here, we do.\" \n\n\nAlmost everyone blames the condition of the motel on manager James Wu and owner \nJau Huang. \n\n\n\"The manager doesn't care about us,\" tenant Sandra Shaw said, plopping down on \nthe bed. \"There are drug deals going on at all hours of the night, screaming. \nWe can't even call 911 because we don't have a phone in the room and we are too \nafraid to go out.\" \n\n\nAlthough Huang has owned the motel only since May, 1988, inspector Pulone says \nhe has made no effort to clean it up and, in fact, has let it become more \nsqualid. Pulone said Huang told him he bought the place sight unseen for $1.5 \nmillion. Huang is listed on a business card as vice chairman of Radisson Plaza \nHotel South Bay, which is scheduled to open in July in Carson. According to \nbuilding permits, Huang is vice president of Wei-Chuan Construction, the \nMonterey Park company now building the Radisson Plaza. \n\n\nHuang, who lives in San Marino, is now in Taiwan, Wu said. Representatives from \nWei-Chuan construction refused to comment on the condition of the Atlantis \nMotel, saying it is Huang's private business, not theirs. However, Wei-Chuan \nConstruction pays the water bills, according to city records. \n\n\nWu blamed the motel's problems on the tenants. \n\n\n\"We paint in the afternoon, they writing by the next morning,\" Wu said. \"Who \ncan handle? I cannot handle.\" \n\n\nWu, who had a pile of eviction notices on his desk, said he has tried to evict \nunruly tenants, but added: \"They don't want to leave.\" \n\n\nPulone is not sympathetic. If Wu can't get rid of unruly tenants, somebody else \nshould, he said. \n\n\n\"You know who I really feel sorry for?\" he said. \"The kids. All those poor \nlittle kids.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0084", "docId": "179732", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Long Beach; Part J; Page 1; Column 6", "length": "909", "headline": "SCHOOL OFFICIAL, CHALLENGED ON DEGREE, QUITS;", "byline": "By MICHELE FUETSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "The associate superintendent of the Compton Unified School District resigned \nunder fire Tuesday after the district learned that he apparently had not earned \nthe college degree that he listed on a job application. \n\n\nJames H. Turner was told to resign, said a district source, who added that if \nhe had refused, acting Supt. Elisa L. Sanchez would have asked the school board \nto fire him. \n\n\nTurner emptied his desk Tuesday afternoon and carried his belongings to his \ncar. He acknowledged that he had resigned but declined to answer questions \nabout his departure, his background or the bachelor's degree he listed from \nIndiana State University in Terre Haute. \n\n\nIn response to district inquiries, Indiana State officials apparently notified \nCompton school officials late last week that the university has no records on \nTurner, who was hired three years ago in the Compton schools as purchasing \ndirector. In 1988, he became associate superintendent in charge of maintenance \nand administrative services. \n\n\nTurner's first brush with controversy occurred in June, when county education \nofficials held up payments to three contractors he had hired to renovate the \ndistrict's administrative offices. \n\n\nIn January, after a six-month review, the Los Angeles County Office of \nEducation told district officials that they would not be allowed to pay the \ncontractors, because the district should have solicited bids for the work. The \ncounty by law approves all bills paid by school districts. \n\n\nOne former school district employee told the county that he had warned Turner \nbefore the contractors were hired that bids should have been sought. According \nto the former employee, Gene Parks, who was business services manager, Turner \nhad replied: \"I have a way around that.\" \n\n\nTurner did not return calls for comment last week. \n\n\nSanchez insisted last week that the district had acted properly in hiring the \ncontractors. She did not return telephone calls Tuesday. \n\n\nSchool board Trustee Kelvin D. Filer insisted that Turner's departure was not \nrelated to the bidding issue. Filer would not say what prompted the district to \nbegin checking Turner's educational background -- three years after he was \nhired. \n\n\nHowever, Filer did say, \"I'm furious about the circumstances that have led up \nto this event.\" \n\n\nFiler refused to elaborate, but he and another school trustee, Manuel Correa, \nsaid the district's personnel commission is in charge of all non-academic \nemployees and was responsible for checking Turner's background. \n\n\nCorrea said that the district is still investigating Turner's background and \nthat the board will issue a statement, probably by the end of the week. \n\n\nTrustee Sam Littleton said Tuesday night that he had not yet been told that \nTurner had resigned. \n\n\n\"I'm trying to figure out how he did get hired,\" Littleton said. \"I guess \npersonnel must have made a mistake somewhere along the line.\" \n\n\nEdward Seidler, director of personnel for non-academic employees, said that \nneither he nor the commission made educational background checks of \nnon-academic applicants until a year ago. \n\n\nSeidler was in charge of classified personnel when Turner and several others \napplied for the associate superintendent's position in October, 1988. But he \nsaid former Supt. Ted D. Kimbrough, who now heads the Chicago school system, \nconducted all the interviews and appointed Turner. The superintendent is \nauthorized to hire the associate superintendent and three other senior \nmanagement posts -- controller, risk manager and director of accounting, \nSeidler said. \n\n\nHe said he did not work for the district when Turner was first hired as \npurchasing director in 1987. \n\n\nCorrea said he thinks that district officials began checking Turner's \nbackground after receiving information that Turner had included false \ninformation on his job application. Correa said he does not know the source of \nthe tip. \n\n\nThe Times has learned that memos about Turner began circulating last month \namong school board members and administration officials. According to sources \nfamiliar with the memos, Turner was asked to produce evidence that he had a \ncollege degree. When he failed to do that, the school district contacted the \nuniversity. \n\n\nIn 1987, when he applied for the position of purchasing director, Turner said \non his job application that he had studied business economics at Indiana State \nin 1959-60. In 1988, when he applied for his most recent position, Turner said \non the application that he had received a bachelor's degree in business \nadministration and economics from the university in 1954. \n\n\nTurner also claimed to have been in the Air Force and to have worked at a \nhealth-care management corporation before joining the school district. \n\n\nCorrea said the district will check all the information on Turner's \napplication. \"Rest assured,\" he said, \"we will get these answers by the end of \nthe week.\" \n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\nJames H. Turner, associate superintendent of maintenance and administrative \nservices in the Compton school district, has been in the center of a dispute \nover the hiring of contractors to renovate the district's administration \nbuilding. County education officials told school officials last month that \nthree contractors cannot be paid for the work because the district failed to \nsolicit bids.

Big trucks, like a diesel-snorting Kenworth \ntractor. And the trailers that go with it. \n\n\nWhen Fish turned 17, he learned to drive -- in an 18-wheeler. That's when he \nbought his first truck. He's been buying and selling them ever since. \n\n\n\"They're big Tonka toys,\" said Fish, whose curly white beard, ample girth and \ntwinkling eyes give him a Santa-Claus like appearance. \n\n\nFish's neighbors are not amused. \n\n\nThey don't like the fact that he parks his equipment on a residential street in \nfront of their homes. Fish purchased his current \"toy\" -- a 1950 green and \nyellow Kenworth tractor, once owned by a dairy -- in Texas two years ago. \n\n\nHe parks it on the street, near his home in the 4400 block of Raymond Avenue. \n\n\nHe also has a flatbed trailer there. \n\n\nAnd a forklift. \n\n\nResidents say the equipment is unsightly, illegal and a safety hazard, blocking \nthe view of motorists on a tight curve at Raymond and Community avenues. They \nhave complained to the County Sheriff's Department, the California Highway \nPatrol, the air quality district, the county zoning department and their county \nsupervisor. About 25 residents in a two-block area signed petitions of protest \nin 1987. \n\n\nFish, 39, has been hauled into court twice. One time he was charged with being \na public nuisance and faced a jail sentence. He has received innumerable \ntickets and his equipment has been impounded. \n\n\nOn every occasion, Fish beat the charges. He won in a jury trial two years ago \nand last year a Municipal Court judge threw out the case. \n\n\nFish and his attorney have successfully argued that county rules permit him to \nkeep the equipment at his house, where he has operated a heavy machinery \nbrokerage since 1975. \n\n\nStill, Fish's neighbors contend that the business and equipment is \ninappropriate in a residential zone and have not relented. At their insistence, \nSupervisor Mike Antonovich last year asked that the district attorney again \npress charges, according to Ollie Blanning, an Antonovich deputy. \n\n\nBut Michael Noyes, a deputy district attorney who closed the case, said he \nrejected a request from the Department of Regional Planning seeking a criminal \ncomplaint against Fish. \n\n\n\"There were no facts in the report, just neighbors complaining,\" Noyes said. \n\"Besides, it has been to court several times before.\" \n\n\nBlanning said most neighborhood disputes are quieted when the offending party \ngives in to pressure and remedies the situation. \"But this has not been easily \nsolved,\" Blanning said. \"It's been like trying to make Jello stick to a wall.\" \n\n\nFish's detractors claim that the jury decision and court ruling were misguided. \n\n\n\"He's wrong,\" said Carolyn Holmgren, who moved into the neighborhood with her \nhusband five years ago. \"He has squeaked under the law. It's just so \nfrustrating.\" \n\n\nMichael T. Wayland, Fish's attorney, called the complaints from neighbors to \ncounty and law enforcement officials \"a gross misuse of public funds. This is a \nstupid neighborhood squabble, a private war.\" \n\n\nFish, who accuses his opponents of being \"a few quarts short,\" said they are \njust jealous of his hobby of collecting old heavy equipment. \"They have never \ncome up with a shard of evidence that I have done anything illegal. \n\n\n\"These neighbors, they just like trouble,\" said Fish, who wears a heavy chain \naround his neck. \"They don't have any hobbies. I'm their hobby.

Home values have soared along \nthe street where it was once common for residents to keep horses and park \ntrucks on the street. Recent buyers are more citified. \"They're not what I call \nthe more old-fashioned rural type like I am.\" \n\n\nFish said he probably would move his wife and three children to a more rural \narea outside Southern California \"if somebody gave me the price for the house. \nI'm not in love with the place by any stretch of the imagination,\" he said. \n\n\nFish's unwelcome collection in the city is not surprising to officials of the \nAmerican Truck Historical Society, a national organization of heavy equipment \nhistory buffs with more than 10,000 members. \n\n\n\"Most people who collect the hardware -- the vehicles -- have some place to \nkeep them, like an old barn in the country,\" said Roy Stewart, managing \ndirector. \"If you're parking them on a street in the city, well, sometimes \nneighbors are unhappy about that.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0086", "docId": "179734", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "San Gabriel Valley; Part J; Page 1; Column 2", "length": "249", "headline": "DEADLINE NEARS FOR FILING IN SENATE ELECTION", "byline": "By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "Would-be candidates have until Monday to file papers allowing them to run in a \nspecial election to fill the state Senate seat vacated by the resignation of \nJoseph B.

White, who was an armored car guard for a security company, was left \nparalyzed by the shooting. \n\n\nIt was Peter Giordano, Swanson said, not Alfred, who attempted the holdup and \nwounded White, now 34. \n\n\nProsecutors have contended that Alfred shot and tried to rob the victim while \nPeter drove the getaway car. During an earlier trial, the brothers faced \ncharges of attempted murder and attempted robbery. They were dressed and \ngroomed similarly and were sitting side by side when White identified Peter \nGiordano as his assailant. White said then that he meant to point to Alfred \nGiordano, instead of Peter, but made a mistake. \n\n\nPeter Giordano, 33, was acquitted last May of the charges. The same charges \nagainst Alfred, 27, ended in a mistrial after jurors deadlocked 11 to 1 in \nfavor of conviction. \n\n\n\"A lot of evidence will point to Peter Giordano, and Peter Giordano alone,\" \nSwanson told jurors last week. \"A man who looks almost identical to Alfred, \nunfortunately.\" \n\n\nDuring four days of trial, Swanson has called Peter Giordano into the courtroom \nseveral times, asking White and others if they are certain it was Alfred and \nnot Peter who assaulted him. Swanson said he may call Peter as a witness, and \nmay ask him whether he was the gunman. \n\n\nThat defense may be formidable, said Deputy Dist. Atty. JoAnn Glidden. Although \nthe brothers' alleged roles in the crime were different, the charges are the \nsame -- and Peter cannot be retried for attempted murder, Glidden said. \n\n\n\"There would be nothing we could do,\" if Peter admits to being the gunman, \nGlidden said. \"He's been acquitted. He has nothing to lose if he comes in here \nand says he actually did it. But I'm not really concerned about it. I think the \njurors are smarter than that.\" \n\n\nIn her opening statement, Glidden told the jury she would present several \nwitnesses who saw Alfred Giordano shoot the security guard. Glidden said other \nwitnesses -- including Alfred's wife -- would testify that he confessed to the \ncrime. \n\n\n\"I'm convinced that after you hear the evidence, you'll know this is not a \nwhodunit, but that this was a willful, deliberate, premeditated attempted \nmurder,\" she told jurors. \n\n\nProsecutors contend White was leaving a check-cashing business on San Fernando \nRoad with an empty money bag when Alfred allegedly confronted him with an Uzi \nmachine gun and demanded the money. When White paused, prosecutors said, Alfred \nGiordano shot him five times, grabbed the bag but dropped it after seeing it \nwas empty and fled to a nearby alley where Peter was waiting in a car. \n\n\nAlthough Swanson has made it clear that Peter Giordano plays an important role \nin Alfred's second trial, the elder brother is now a spectator. He said outside \nthe courtroom Tuesday that if he is called as a witness, he would invoke his \nFifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and not answer any questions. \n\n\nJudge Terry Smerling has said he would conduct a hearing to determine Peter \nGiordano's rights if he is called as a witness. \n\n\n\"Swanson has me here because of the identification problem,\" Peter Giordano \nsaid. \"The evidence does point to me. But if I do take the stand, I don't think \nI'd want to incriminate myself.\" \n\n\nLast week, testifying from his wheelchair, White identified his assailant as \nAlfred Giordano, who sat alone. \"He was the one. I have no doubt in my mind,\" \nhe told Glidden. \n\n\nOn Tuesday, Sherry Maxwell, who was in a convenience store near the \ncheck-cashing business the morning of the shooting, testified she had seen \nAlfred Giordano, not Peter, walk past her after White was shot. \n\n\nAnother eyewitness who was at the scene also is expected this week to identify \nAlfred Giordano as the gunman. \n\n\nBut Glidden acknowledged that problems may arise with the prosecution's key \nwitness: Alfred Giordano's wife, Kimberly. \n\n\nThe woman testified during a preliminary hearing that Alfred told her after the \nshooting that he shot an armored car guard. She also said she saw her husband \nbury a gun in the back yard of her Lancaster home. \n\n\nIn the first trial she admitted to the previous testimony but altered it \nslightly by saying she never saw her husband bury a gun. \n\n\nBoth Glidden and Swanson said they are uncertain what Kimberly Giordano will \nsay on the stand. But the prosecutor said other witnesses, such as Kimberly's \nuncle, will testify that Kimberly told them about Alfred's confession not long \nafter the shooting. \n\n\nSwanson has long argued that Kimberly Giordano had a sexual relationship with \nGlendale Police Officer Joseph Jimenez, the primary investigator in the case, \nand that Jimenez paid her advance reward money to elicit her testimony. \n\n\nScott Howard, Glendale's assistant city attorney, said Wednesday that a defense \nrequest for a police department investigation of Jimenez was denied. Jimenez in \nthe first trial denied Swanson's allegations. \n\n\n\"We will hear testimony by a woman who has been confused and corrupted by all \nsorts of influences,\" Swanson told jurors last week. \"The evidence will show \nthat the testimony, whatever it will be, bears more than a little scrutiny.\" \n\n\nAlfred Giordano is being held in County Jail without bail."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0088", "docId": "179742", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "San Gabriel Valley; Part J; Page 1; Column 5", "length": "420", "headline": "MANSLAUGHTER VERDICT IN SHOTGUN DEATH;", "byline": "By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "A 21-year-old Azusa man accused of murdering his neighbor in a dispute over \nloud music has been found guilty of the lesser charge of voluntary \nmanslaughter, as well as three other felonies stemming from the June 30 \nshooting. \n\n\nDonald Ternus, a truck loader at an electronics warehouse, faces a maximum 16 \nyears in state prison for the assault, a racially charged incident that \noccurred on a crime-plagued cul-de-sac after a night of beer-drinking. \n\n\nHe is scheduled to be sentenced March 19 by Pomona Superior Court Judge Robert \nMartinez. \n\n\nProsecutors had argued that Ternus committed first- or second-degree murder \nwhen, after trading epithets, he marched over to Anthony Ortiz's apartment with \na loaded shotgun and blasted the 37-year-old glass cutter in the stomach and \nhead. \n\n\nBut after seven days of deliberations, a 10-man, two-woman jury Tuesday found \nTernus guilty of voluntary manslaughter, indicating that they believed the \nshooting was not a premeditated execution but a crime of passion. \n\n\n\"Obviously, I was disappointed,\" said Deputy Dist.

Brock & Sons Inc. informed the district last week that the agreement \nwas canceled because of additional restrictions being placed on the proposed \ndevelopment by the city, schools Supt. Edward A.

The remaining $2.25 million was to be paid as homes were sold. \n\n\nThe district planned to use about $5 million of the money to refurbish several \nbuildings at Downey High School, and the remainder to pay for renovation at \nother schools in the district. \n\n\nThe developer must meet city planning, zoning and building requirements to \nconstruct the project. City officials said they have not been unreasonable nor \nplaced too many restrictions on the project. \n\n\n\"We felt that Brock had a very workable plan, but there were some problems,\" \nAssistant City Manager Ken Farfsing said. \n\n\nFarfsing said the developer had not submitted a formal application but was \nproposing to build 85 homes on lots smaller than allowed by the city. Farfsing \nsaid the developer revised the plan by reducing the number of homes, but the \nproposed streets were not wide enough for parking and safety reasons. The city \nalso required the developer to use two lots for a small park. \n\n\nThe city was prepared to meet with the developer to discuss the requirements \nwhen the company canceled the agreement with the school district, Farfsing \nsaid. \n\n\nEric Bathen, legal counsel for the school district, accused the city of \"just \ngiving the developer the runaround.\" \n\n\nFarfsing denied the charge. He said it is \"part of the process we go through \nwith developers.\" \n\n\nBathen said he received a letter from the development company last Tuesday \nsaying that the company was withdrawing because of \"mixed signals and \ninconsistency\" from city officials and because of the declining real estate \nmarket. \n\n\nBathen said the developer had estimated that the proposed homes could sell for \nbetween $300,000 and $400,000. \n\n\nBathen said the district had received a deposit of $100,000 and was to receive \nan additional deposit of $150,000 Feb. 12, but after getting the city's letter \non the same day, the developer decided to cancel the agreement. \n\n\nBrock vice president Les Thomas said he would have no comment on the matter. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Sussman said the district would continue to negotiate with Brock and \nother developers to work out a deal. \n\n\n\"We are optimistic we can work something out,\" Sussman said. \"We are trying to \ndo the very best for the district and for the city. We also have an obligation \nto get all of our schools refurbished.\" \n\n\nDowney High School has several buildings that are in need of repair, Sussman \nsaid.

Shannon said Wednesday. \n\n\nLong Beach wins most lawsuits filed against it, Shannon said. An estimated 20% \nto 25% of them involve the police, according to City Atty. John R. Calhoun. \n\n\nNot everyone involved in the controversy over compiling the information \nembraced the compromise, which was proposed by Calhoun and Councilman Tom \nClark. \n\n\nFor commissioners, who had hoped that such information would help them spot \npatterns and problem areas, the compromise was far from what was requested. The \npanel wanted a list of all police-related settlements and judgments. \n\n\nCommission members echoed concerns of other community leaders, who criticized \nthe council for secretly settling a $330,000 police brutality lawsuit in \nDecember. While council members denied trying to hide the settlement, they \nnonetheless agreed two months ago to note publicly any final settlement \napproved in closed sessions. \n\n\n\"We did ask for much more than what you seem agreeable to providing,\" \nCommissioner Barbara Shoag told the council before its Tuesday vote. \n\n\nFred Kugler, a spokesman for Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, said: \"I think \nit's the best we could get out of the council.\" \n\n\n\"The public will now have a better idea of the nature of settlements, but in \nterms of evaluating trends, the information won't be adequate,\" he said after \nthe meeting. \n\n\nThe compromise also failed to satisfy members of the council, who last week \ndenied the request for information on the grounds that it would take too much \ntime and cost too much for city staff members to compile. \n\n\nThe information, they said, is available to anyone willing to do the legwork to \ndig it up and would not provide clear evidence of patterns, because settlements \ndo not always mean someone did something wrong. \n\n\n\"The ability to categorize or come up with patterns is next to impossible,\" \nCouncilwoman Jan Hall said. \n\n\nHall said that the commission will look for trends by reviewing about 45 cases \nand that just some of those will involve police. \n\n\n\"I think that's crazy,\" Hall said. \"I don't think that makes sense.\" \n\n\nCouncilman Jeff Kellogg agreed with Hall, and both voted against ordering city \nstaff to compile the data. Joining Clark -- the only councilman who supported \nthe commission's request last week -- were Councilmen Evan Anderson Braude, \nWallace Edgerton, Ray Grabinski, Warren Harwood, Les Robbins and Clarence \nSmith. \n\n\nBut most of the councilmen said they were changing their votes not because they \nsupport the compromise but because of the public outcry that their vote \ngenerated last week. \n\n\nCommunity leaders were outraged that the council had refused to help the \ncommission gather the data. Although council members insisted that the \ninformation is public and available to anyone, commissioners said they have \nneither the resources nor the knowledge to gather the information themselves. \n\n\nIn essence, they said, the council's refusal to help was tantamount to denying \nthem the information. \n\n\nCouncil members repeated Tuesday that they are not trying to hide any \nsettlement. Nonetheless, the majority changed its vote to appease critics. \n\n\n\"Once again, the council will take a position based on newspaper reaction,\" \nsaid Edgerton, referring to an editorial in the Press-Telegram that criticized \nthe council for its original vote. \n\n\nIn casting his vote, Harwood alluded to the upcoming election and said the \nPublic Safety Advisory Commission is taking advantage of the \"political \nseason.\" Four of the nine council members face re-election. Harwood and \nGrabinski are unopposed. \n\n\n\"The council is being put in a squeeze,\" with the impression that to deny the \ncommission's request is the same as denying access to public records, Harwood \nsaid. \n\n\nHe questioned whether this would set a precedent that would encourage other \ncommissions and committees to ask the city to compile other information, such \nas: \"How many homes have tile roofs?\" Harwood said. \n\n\nGrabinski, who was strongly opposed to the commission's request, voted for the \ncompromise, but even as he announced his vote he added: \"I hope it doesn't \npass.\" \n\n\nLast week, council members said they feared that the commission would \nsecond-guess their decisions. The council, on the advice of the city's \nattorneys, makes final decisions on what cases to settle out of court and for \nwhat amounts. \n\n\nAt the time, community activists called the council's refusal to help the \ncommission gather the information \"atrocious\" and \"the supreme insult to the \nconstituents.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0091", "docId": "179751", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "San Gabriel Valley; Part J; Page 2; Column 4", "length": "125", "headline": "GENTRIFICATION CAN TAKE A TOLL ON HUMANS", "byline": null, "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "I have followed, with interest, your intermittent articles dealing with (staff \nwriter) Berkley Hudson's move to Eldora Road in Pasadena. \n\n\nAs I have worked in this area for four years, I've watched the slow, gradual \nchange with interest and anticipation. \n\n\nI agree with your appraisal of the neighbors (people) and homes.

The public, however, chose to interpret the invitation \nmore broadly as an occasion to demonstrate its mettle for a long campaign. \n\n\nOutside, members of the Coalition to Preserve Open Reservoirs waved a few \nplacards. Otherwise, they were generally diplomatic. They refrained from \nshouting down the DWP staff. They waited their turn to speak. They held their \napplause for a few dramatic moments. \n\n\nAssemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), a resident of Silver Lake, spoke first \nand set the proper martial tone. \n\n\n\"Look into the faces in this room tonight,\" Roos said. \"Residents of our \ncommunity are buffeted by powerful forces they cannot control, forces tearing \nat the very fabric of our neighborhoods: crime, drug abuse, urban blight, \ntraffic gridlock. Now they are concerned that a public agency, an institution \nthat should be working with them, may take away the very foundation of our \nneighborhood, the centerpiece that helps define and preserve our neighborhood.\" \n\n\nCouncilman Michael Woo, who also lives in Silver Lake, offered his own \ndefinition of audience participation. \n\n\n\"Only by having a large, organized and vocal opposition to covering reservoirs \nwill we be able to stop what I believe is a senseless folly on the part of the \nDWP,\" he said. \n\n\nThat was one of the dramatic moments when the audience let loose. \n\n\nThe DWP's obviously practiced method for handling the criticism was to offer no \nresponse at all. \n\n\nThough several of its top officials attended, the agency did not conduct the \nmeeting itself. That job was in the hands of a professional facilitator hired \nfor the series. \n\n\nHe said his role was simply to gather information. Even under intense \nprovocation, he kept his composure. \n\n\nWhen one speaker, Bennett Kayser, called the water improvement program a sham \nand suggested that it should be the \"alleged water improvement project,\" the \nfacilitator asked smoothly what it should be called instead. \n\n\n\"Filtration and covering for 10 reservoirs,\" Kayser snapped back. \n\n\n\"I'm sorry I asked,\" the facilitator quipped. \n\n\nKayser suggested adding mental health as a component of the environmental \nstudy. \n\n\n\"What's going to happen to the people of Silver Lake when instead of seeing a \nreservoir, they see a filtration plant down there?\" he asked. \n\n\nSome speakers offered quasi-scientific, others personal experience to counter \nthe DWP's approach. \n\n\nOne man said he lived through a dysentery outbreak caused by fungus that grew \nunder a reservoir cover. \n\n\n\"Saying that covering these reservoirs is some sort of solution to clean water, \nit isn't at all,\" he said. \"It's just creating another problem. It's sort of \ngunge in the Thermos.\" \n\n\nEven the DWP staff had a laugh at that one. \n\n\nBut they became stone-faced a few minutes later when Dale Flanagan of the \nCommittee to Save Silver Lake's Reservoirs quoted from a document that he said \nwas written 12 years ago by the DWP staff. \n\n\n\"The resistance met during a recent construction of the Silver Lake reservoir \nindicates the typical response likely to be encountered if any view of the \nwater surface is diminished.\" \n\n\nWaving the document overhead, he said: \"Heed your own warnings . . . Because I \ncan guarantee you, you're not going to have a fight on your hands. You're going \nto have a war.\" \n\n\nThe facilitator waited for the cheers to die down before observing dryly: \n\n\n\"I think it's terribly unfair to use our own words against us like that.\" \n\n\nAt an appropriately dramatic moment, a speaker called for a show of hands on \nwho was on his side. Hundreds of hands shot up. \n\n\nIt's going to be a long one."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0096", "docId": "179762", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Long Beach; Part J; Page 2; Column 1", "length": "267", "headline": "COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER;", "byline": null, "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, Calderon", "text": "Would-be candidates have until Monday to file papers allowing them to run in a \nspecial election to fill the state Senate seat vacated by the resignation of \nJoseph B.

It has been my experience personally and as a historian \n. . . that when high emotion surfaces over issues it says a great deal more \nabout the people who are rejecting groups than it does about groups \nthemselves.\" \n\n\nThe problem confronting the campus is one of \"prejudice, rumor, false \naccusation, questions of human dignity, of civil rights and ignorance,\" she \nsaid. \n\n\nRabe also said she was disturbed by \"violence in the words . . . and in the \nattitudes\" among some students toward gays and lesbians. \n\n\nThe 12-member alliance was formed last spring in an off-campus apartment. This \nyear, the group sought official recognition from the university, including the \nright to meet on campus. University President James N. Loughran last week \ndenied the group official recognition, but granted them access to campus \nfacilities and support services. \n\n\nThe decision was announced in a brief unsigned statement issued by the \nuniversity's public relations office, and was accompanied by a two-page press \nrelease. It said the university cannot condone \"a sexually active, homosexual \nlife style\" but should \"support those among us who happen to be homosexual.\" \n\n\nAlliance President James Munselle, one of the five panelists, told the forum \nthat the group is disappointed by Loughran's decision. \n\n\n\"We believe all people have a right not to be invisible, not to be segregated, \nnot to be distinguished from other people as inferior,\" Munselle said. \n\n\nPanelist Father Michael O'Sullivan, a Jesuit priest who said he supported the \ngroup's right to meet on campus, was asked as a theologian to explain church \npolicy on homosexuality. He said the Catholic Church does not condemn \nhomosexual orientation and in fact \"supports gays and lesbians in terms of \npeople who are a minority who suffer prejudice, who suffer discrimination.\" \n\n\nBut, he added, \"the church does condemn homosexual genital sexual activity\" \nbecause it takes place outside of marriage and because, \"by its nature it \ncannot lead to procreation.\" \n\n\nSenior Brad Collins, a panel member who earlier this month voted against a \nstudent senate resolution supporting the group, said he was disappointed that \nthe panel was not more representative of the campus. He was the only panelist \nwho supported Loughran. \n\n\n\"I would hope future forums would be a little more evenly balanced,\" Collins \nsaid. \"I know there are people who have very different opinions than were \nrepresented today.\" \n\n\nOne student asked the panel members to speculate why Loughran denied the group \nrecognition, but panel members declined. Munselle urged students to write or \ncall the president's office asking for an explanation. \n\n\nAnother student supposed that the university \"said no because the (gay) group \nisn't treating homosexuality as a sin.\" \n\n\nRabe pointed out, however, that the church sees any sex outside of marriage -- \neven gay sex -- as a sin. Homosexuality itself is not a sin, she said, as shown \nby the church's permitting homosexuals to be priests if they take a vow of \ncelibacy. \n\n\nOther panel members also said the issue of sin couldn't be the deciding one \nbecause other campus clubs are not asked whether their beliefs conform with \nchurch policy. \n\n\n\"Does Air Force ROTC discuss whether killing is a sin?\" O'Sullivan asked. He \nsaid other campus clubs are not required to state whether their members have \nsex outside of marriage, which the church views as sinful. \n\n\nTravis Lawmaster, a member of the student senate who voted against the club, \nsaid the panel had not addressed the counseling needs of individual gays, \nespecially those who want to refrain from homosexual sex. \n\n\nHe said gays need to accept Christ and the word of the Bible, which allows \ncelibacy or sex within heterosexual marriage. Lawmaster questioned whether the \nclub could \"match up with these alternatives,\" which would open the way for it \nto be permitted on campus. \n\n\nBut Munselle responded that alliance group members are not confused about their \nhomosexuality. \"That's not this club,\" he said. \"This is a group of people \nstruggling with discrimination,\" he said. Homosexual students seeking spiritual \nor psychological guidance would be referred to counselors, he said. \n\n\nMichael Doyle, director of counseling services who was also on the panel, said \ngay students who are facing spiritual crisis \"find it very difficult to find \nanswers when the consistent message they hear from the church is negative. \nThat's not the church's stance, but that's the message they hear in statements \nlike this one that Father Loughran has issued.\" \n\n\nSince Loughran's decision, attorney Gloria Allred, who represents Munselle, has \nsent the president a letter asking him to meet with the group. Allred \ncriticized the university's statement, which said the university \"cannot \nendorse or condone, or appear to endorse or condone a sexually active, \nhomosexual life style.\" \n\n\nMunselle argued that the group's purpose, as stated in its constitution, is to \neducate and to support the human rights of its members. \n\n\nAllred and members of both the undergraduate and law school gay students' \nalliances said they will picket Loughran's office today because the statement \nwas \"issued by some nameless and faceless individual\" and was not signed by \nLoughran. Allred said they will seek an explanation from Loughran of why he \nrejected the group's application. \n\n\nPanel members discussed the possibility of holding more forums, and some \nstudents agreed it seems a good idea. \n\n\n\"People don't know what the real issues are,\" one student told the panel. \"I \ncame here with questions and after hearing the discussion, I think the club \nshould be approved.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0098", "docId": "179764", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Long Beach; Part J; Page 3; Column 1", "length": "181", "headline": "15 BUILDINGS PROPOSED FOR HISTORIC STATUS", "byline": null, "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "After two years of study, Whittier officials are proposing that the city \ndesignate 15 buildings as historic structures, covered by a special code that \nprohibits owners from altering the buildings' appearance without city approval. \n\n\nThe City Council deferred action Tuesday night, and scheduled a study session \nMarch 13 to discuss the proposal. \n\n\nSome owners of the buildings complained that the city's proposal is an \ninfringement of their rights. \n\n\n\"I want to be allowed to get up on a Saturday morning and paint my front steps \n. . . without getting a work permit,\" Barbara Light, the owner of one of the \nhomes, told the council Tuesday night. \"I want to be allowed to select the \ncolors of the paint on my home and decide whether my bushes need to be pruned.\" \n\n\nBut local conservationists say that regulations are needed to protect the \ncity's historic resources. \n\n\n\"These are not just resources that belong to individuals,\" said Helen Rahder, \nspokeswoman for the Whittier Conservancy. \"These are resources that belong to \nthe community.

That was something to ponder after he finished a few years of \nmedical school. \n\n\n\"When I first got here it was, 'Hey these are the sports I play and these are \nthe ones I'm going to play in high school,' \" Allan recalled. \"I thought \neveryone would do that.\" \n\n\nIt soon became apparent to Allan that his hypothesis was false. \n\n\nMost high school athletes limit their participation to one or two sports. Some \ndo it because those are the only ones in which they are interested or capable. \nOthers are instructed -- and sometimes pressured -- by coaches, parents or \nscouts to concentrate on a single activity that might earn them a college \nscholarship or a professional contract. \n\n\nAllan, however, kept to his plan and thus became part of a shrinking breed -- \nthe three-sport athlete. \n\n\nThe only things more impressive than Allan's independence are his \naccomplishments on the playing field and in the classroom. \n\n\nConsider: \n\n\nHe is an almost certain two-time All-Southern Section and three-time All-Rio \nHondo League soccer player who helped lead La Canada to the 1-A championship \nlast season. \n\n\nHe was selected to the Times All-Glendale and Rio Hondo League football teams \nlast fall after booting, among other less spectacular kicks, two field goals \nfrom 49 yards and one each from 45, 44 and 43 yards. \n\n\nHe is a returning all-league first baseman for the La Canada baseball team, \nbatting .423 last season. \n\n\nHe was a member of the school's Academic Decathlon team and a National Merit \nScholarship semifinalist who scored in the 97th percentile on the \nPre-Scholastic Aptitude Test. \n\n\nIf ever there was a money player, it's Allan, who also serves as senior class \ntreasurer. \n\n\n\"Baseball is my favorite sport,\" Allan says. \"It's the hardest sport of all of \nthem and I think that might be the reason I like it. \n\n\n\"It's more challenging.\" \n\n\nAllan is hoping to compete in at least two sports in college. Stanford, UCLA, \nCal and Claremont-McKenna are among his top choices. \n\n\nHis most immediate challenge, though, is helping a young Spartan soccer team \nrepeat as Southern Section champion. \n\n\nOn Tuesday, Allan contributed an assist on what proved to be the game-winning \nby goal by Jensen Jaraba as the top-ranked Spartans beat No. 2 Agoura, 3-1, in \na second-round playoff game. \n\n\nLa Canada (23-1-2) meets La Mirada, a 3-2 winner Tuesday over Canyon Springs, \nin a quarterfinal game on Friday. \n\n\nAllan, 6-foot-2, 180 pounds, leads La Canada with 22 goals. He scored most of \nthose during the first part of the season when Spartan co-Coaches Afshin Ghotbi \nand Louie Bilowitz moved him to offensive midfield and experimented with \nyounger players at defensive positions. \n\n\nBut once league play began, Allan returned to sweeper. Since moving back to \ndefense, La Canada has allowed just four goals in 12 games. \n\n\n\"Ross is a brilliant reader of the game,\" Bilowitz said. \"He's excellent in the \nair and knows how to position himself in the right place. \n\n\n\"If he needs to make a quick short pass, he can.

AXEL \nKOESTER / For The Times", "text": "Poly High School is driving for another CIF Southern Section basketball title \nunder Coach Ron Palmer, just as the Jackrabbits did in 1984 when they were 31-2 \nand also tacked on a state championship. \n\n\nMorlon Wiley, Terry Stallworth and Chris Sandle were the main players then, and \nPalmer was winding up a highly successful 11-year career. He would soon leave \nfor Cal State Long Beach, making the almost unheard-of jump from high school to \ncollege Division I, a jump that would turn out to be disastrous. \n\n\nNow, the stars are Willie McGinest, Roderick Hannibal, Melvin Jones and Tyus \nEdney, who have the talent for which Poly has always been known. They looked \nsharp Tuesday night in a 74-59 victory over Simi Valley in a quarterfinal \nplayoff game at Lakewood High. \n\n\nAnd Palmer is back, still wearing his dark green sports coat, sitting hunched \nover with elbows on knees, holding up signs that read \"time out\" or \"1-3-1\" and \noffering sharp advice to his players and the officials. \n\n\n\"Hey, ref, what did he do? This is a contact sport,\" he complained when a foul \nwas called on a Poly player. \n\n\n\"Three seconds? Oh, come on,\" he said in disbelief, shaking his head and \nbreaking into his familiar smile when an official ruled that a Jackrabbit was \nin the free-throw lane too long. \n\n\n\"Why is that so hard to remember?\" he asked his team sternly after someone \nmissed an assignment. \n\n\nDuring his first tenure at Poly, Palmer's record was 270-51. He won nine Moore \nLeague titles and was in seven CIF championship games, winning three. He went \nout with the state crown in 1984. \n\n\n\"I kind of remember that team, I remember coming to the games,\" said McGinest, \na preteen then but now an imposing 6-foot-7 center, after he scored 20 points \nand 11 rebounds against Simi Valley. \n\n\nMcGinest is also a football linebacker who is going to USC. Some think he might \nbe the next Lawrence Taylor. \n\n\n\"I just remember how good they were,\" McGinest went on. \"And I remember Palmer. \nI had heard a lot about him. He was like a legend, a famous coach. But I never \nmet him until he came back this season.\" \n\n\nPalmer, after three seasons and a 23-64 record at Cal State Long Beach, was out \nof basketball the last two seasons. He returned to Poly last May to replace \nChris Kinder, who was forced out. \n\n\nKinder was 79-52 in five seasons, but his sin was not winning the CIF \nchampionship, something not easily forgiven at Poly, a school that has a \nbasketball reputation as a junior UCLA. \n\n\n\"It's been an exceptional year,\" Palmer said Tuesday morning at the storefront \nschool near downtown Long Beach where he teaches junior high students who have \nhad discipline problems. \n\n\nHe looked fresh and relaxed, unlike the day three years ago when he resigned \nunder pressure at the university. Beaten down by the losing, he was tired and \nthin, and his stomach hurt. \n\n\n\"That was an aging experience,\" he said. \"This is a totally different world \nthan the college world. I felt my age, I don't feel it now. I'm 52 and I feel \nlike I'm 30 something, doing what I've always done, coaching.\" \n\n\nPoly is 24-2 this season and has won 17 consecutive games. The Jackrabbits' \nonly losses have been to Artesia and, in a December tournament in Texas, to \nDenton (Tex.) High. \n\n\nPalmer was 4-23 and 7-22 his first two seasons at Cal State Long Beach before \nimproving to 12-19. \n\n\nThe losses came with such regularity at the university that they eventually \nnumbed Palmer. \"In high school losing hurts more because you're always in the \ngame, especially at Poly,\" he said. \n\n\nWith the 49ers, Palmer was at first plagued with mediocre talent. When he did \nget some athletes, they had a difficult time scoring, just as the good athletes \ndo at Cal State Long Beach today. \n\n\n\"People out-jumped us and out-quicked us (at Cal State Long Beach),\" he said. \n\"Here, we can jump over your heads and put it in the basket. \n\n\nPalmer believes that the big, talented players who can do everything on the \ncourt continue to go to schools such as North Carolina, Nevada Las Vegas and \nGeorgetown. \n\n\n\"At Long Beach State you get some athletes, but guys who can do it all, \nincluding shoot, are at other schools. \n\n\n\"I found out there was a vast difference in ability across the country. On the \nEast Coast you have guys 6-7 and 6-8 dribbling the ball like a guard. They have \nmore skills. And they play a more physical style that helps players adjust from \nhigh school to college. Here (in high school) a player gets touched and it's a \nfoul.\" \n\n\nPalmer points to several reasons for his failure at Cal State Long Beach. \n\n\n\"I always thought we probably tried to achieve too much too soon, playing \nGeorgetown and other nationally ranked teams,\" he said. \n\n\nHe also complained about having had to play the first 13 games on the road his \nsecond season and not being able to hold full-team practices because a gym \nrenovation forced night practices, which some of the players could not attend \nbecause of classes. \n\n\nAnd he was distressed because he said he could never guarantee decent-paying \nsummer jobs for his players. \n\n\nIn his last season at the university, which ended with eight consecutive \nlosses, team morale had broken down and his quiet style was often criticized by \nplayers and team boosters. \n\n\n\"It was getting to me,\" he recalled. \"I hold everything back, I think it was \nready to come out. When you lose, all those things start to surface, nerves are \nfrayed. If you have problems, winning will take care of all of them, and \nunhappy kids will be happy.\" \n\n\nNow Palmer is back where he is comfortable and where defeats are rarely a \nproblem. \n\n\n\"I appreciate winning more now than I did at Poly before,\" he said. \"I took it \nfor granted before.\" \n\n\nDespite the travails of the intervening years, changes in Palmer are \nindiscernible. \n\n\n\"You can tell his college experience has added to his coaching ability, but \nhe's basically the same type of coach,\" said Erroll Parker, a Poly assistant \ncoach. \"He's very well organized, he's a good teacher and he's blessed with \ntalent and good support.\" \n\n\nAnd so the legend has come home, although it seems like he never left."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0103", "docId": "179781", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Westside; Part J; Page 12; Column 1", "length": "1063", "headline": "VETERAN UCLA GYMNAST SEEKS THE POT OF GOLD FOR BRUINS -- AN NCAA CROWN;", "byline": "By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, Jill Andrews has a 9.75 in the floor exercise this season. But a Bruin \nteam championship is her goal. ; Photo, Bruin gymnast Jill Andrews UCLA photo", "text": "If Jill Andrews, UCLA All-American gymnast, tries to tell you she is over the \nhill -- as she has sometimes been heard to say -- don't believe her. \n\n\nA 21-year-old senior, Andrews is a bit long in the tooth for a gymnast, \nespecially when you consider that she has been at it for 12 years and that Mary \nLou Retton retired at 16 after winning the all-around title at the 1984 \nOlympics. \n\n\nYet Andrews is a long way from being washed up. Last year she was an NCAA \nco-champion on the balance beam, and this year she is having one of her best \nseasons. \n\n\nIn UCLA's first meet of the season, she scored a 38.35 in the all-around to set \na John Wooden Center record and increased that record to 38.60 in the team's \nthird meet. \n\n\nIn that first meet, she tied a Wooden Center record with a 9.75 in the vault \nand broke that record with a 9.85 in the third meet. \n\n\nAlso this season, she has won the all-around competition three times, placed \nfirst on the beam four times and took two seconds on the bars. \n\n\nNot bad for an old-timer. \n\n\nShe might be approaching the crest of the hill; this is, after all, her last \nyear in gymnastics. But she has one more goal in her sport before she starts \ntaking that downhill slide. \n\n\nShe would like to get better career marks in individual events; who wouldn't? \n\n\nBut you can't get much better than a 9.90 in the vault, a 9.75 in floor \nexercise, a 9.70 in the uneven bars, a 9.80 in the balance beam and a 38.80 out \nof a possible 40 points in the all-around. \n\n\nYou can't get much better than being the top-ranked college vaulter in the \nnation this season, No. 4 in the balance beam, No. 2 in the all-around. \n\n\nAndrews' teammate, All-American senior teammate Kim Hamilton, also has an \nindividual goal. Last year Hamilton, who holds the national record of 9.90 in \nfloor exercise, became the first woman gymnast to win three consecutive NCAA \nchampionships in floor exercise. Assuredly, she would like to make it four \nstraight. \n\n\nBut she and Andrews, teammates for four years, have yet to help the Bruins win \nan NCAA title, a prize they would both like to add to their individual laurels \nbefore they get out of gymnastics. \n\n\nUCLA has come so close to winning a national team championship in the last \nthree years that it is \"a huge source of frustration,\" Andrews said. The Bruins \nwere third to NCAA champion Georgia in 1987, third to Alabama in '88 and second \nto Georgia last year by five-hundredths (.05) of a point at a meet held at \nGeorgia's campus in Athens. \n\n\n\"You couldn't lose by less,\" said Andrews, adding: \n\n\n\"When we were (competing) on the balance beam, they were (doing) floor \nexercise. They blew out six speakers with the loud music they were playing. \n\n\n\"They (Georgia) did a good job, but I think there was a little hometown \nfavoritism (in the judging).\" \n\n\nThis year's NCAA meet will be held April 20-21 at Oregon State in Corvallis. \nThat would be a neutral site for a showdown between Georgia and UCLA, should \nboth teams get that far. And it's a pretty good bet that they will. \n\n\nAndrews is \"off to a dynamite start,\" said UCLA Coach Jerry Tomlinson, but his \nteam, troubled by injuries and inexperience, has been something less than \nexplosive. The Bruins have a 6-2 record in dual meets, having lost to Oregon \nState and Nebraska. \n\n\nAll-American Shawn McGinnis, the only other senior on the team, is out for the \nseason because she tore ligaments in her foot. She may redshirt and return next \nseason. \n\n\nFreshman Rhonda Faehn, an alternate on the 1988 U.S. Olympic team, suffered a \nstrained Achilles tendon and missed several meets. She has returned and posted \na 9.4 in floor exercise in UCLA's last meet. \n\n\nFreshman Paula Rasmussen sprained an ankle but recently came back to record a \n9.2 on the balance beam. \n\n\nEven the 5-foot-2-inch, 110-pound Andrews, who Tomlinson says is \"built like a \nrock\" and is seldom injured, sprained an ankle in the team's second meet of the \nseason at Oregon State. But she has shaken off the injury and is back in top \nform. \n\n\nAndrews said that she has been \"lucky, extremely lucky\" in avoiding injuries. \n\"I'm strong, which helps prevent injuries. \n\n\n\"When I'm competing, (the sprained ankle) is not even a factor. I don't think \nabout it till after the meet. It's no big deal if you get treatment after the \nmeet and take care of it.\" \n\n\nTomlinson said that Andrews is \"a very, very exciting gymnast to watch because \nof her power and intensity. She is a perfectionist. \n\n\n\"She is not one of the most talented gymnasts to come though here, but she is \ntalented. She works very hard to get everything she has and works very hard to \nperfect (her routines).\" \n\n\nTomlinson said that Andrews, a native of Cupertino, has taken on an added role \nof being a team leader this year. \"She is assuming a role that is not always a \npopular one. She is doing a really good job of setting the pace, stepping in \nfor Tanya Service.\" Service, an assistant coach this year, completed her \neligibility after being named the 1989 Pacific 10 Conference Gymnast of the \nyear. \n\n\nAndrews said that she thinks that she and Hamilton have become leaders \"by \nvirtue of being seniors. You kind of assume the leadership role and hope it is \nbased on setting an example.\" \n\n\nTomlinson hopes that Andrews will set an example by leading the Bruins to an \nNCAA championship. \"She hates to lose, and she brings a lot of desire and \nenergy to our team. She can be a big driving force in our quest for a national \ntitle.\" \n\n\nAndrews said she thinks that the Bruins \"have the skills\" to win at nationals, \n\"and we are steadily improving. We started out slowly this year; usually, we \njump right out. I don't know. Maybe that's a good sign, a sign that we haven't \npeaked early.\" \n\n\nShe said that she hopes that the team may have gotten its worst performance of \nthe season out of its system: the loss at Oregon State, where the Bruins \nsuffered 13 falls out of 24 routines. \n\n\nShe thinks that the team, with many new members, may have gotten over the \njitters of its first road meet of the season. \"It couldn't have been worse, but \nI think it was a good learning experience. We've gradually developed since \nthen.\" \n\n\nThere is one more development that Andrews is waiting for: a national \nchampionship for the Bruins. \n\n\n\"I'd like to go out in style and win the all-around championship, but I'll be \nsatisfied with whatever happens to me individually. To me it's more important \nthat the team win a championship.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0104", "docId": "179782", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Westside; Part J; Page 12; Column 6", "length": "975", "headline": "SPORTSCOPE;", "byline": null, "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "The UCLA/Los Angeles Times women's gymnastics invitational will be held at 7 \np.m. Saturday at Pauley Pavilion.

I'm talking about the \nplayers, not the conference officials.\" \n\n\nWhile on the subject of Smith, the Tar Heels lost a recruit to Stanford two \nyears ago for a most unusual reason. \n\n\nAdam Keefe, then a senior at Woodbridge High School in Irvine, had decided he \nwanted to play both basketball and volleyball in college, and although the Tar \nHeels aren't known for their prowess in the beach sport, North Carolina were \nstill on his list of considered schools. \n\n\nBetween Keefe's junior and senior years, North Carolina assistant Bill \nGuthridge tried to call Woodbridge Coach Bill Shannon to express an interest in \nKeefe. \n\n\nTrouble was, Shannon didn't answer, because the school's athletic offices were \nclosed for refurbishing. Whoever picked up the phone told Guthridge that Keefe \nwasn't interested. \n\n\n\"We think it was a construction worker,\" Keefe told the Orange County Register. \n\n\nAt any rate, before North Carolina discovered what had happened, Stanford had \nestablished a foothold for Keefe. \n\n\nYou don't suppose that Lefty Driesell posed as a construction worker just to \nconfound his old nemesis, do you? \n\n\nProbably not. \n\n\nLess than three weeks remain before those office pools start turning up and \nBrent Musburger becomes a staple in your household, sort of the know-it-all \nuncle you wish you didn't have. \n\n\nIt's getting to be NCAA tournament time and in preparation for college \nbasketball's answer to the World Series and Super Bowl, Jim Delaney, chairman \nof the nine-member NCAA Division I selection committee, met the press by phone. \n\n\nDelaney, who is also Big Ten commissioner, said the committee already has met \nonce to discuss criteria for inviting the 64 teams -- 30 automatic qualifiers \nand 34 at-large teams -- to participate in the big dance that culminates with \nthe Final Four in Denver at the end of March. \n\n\nDelaney said the committee will likely begin meeting in a Kansas City hotel the \nThursday before invitations are sent out on March 11, and caucus through the \nweekend to come up with the nominees. \n\n\nDelaney expects the committee will make recommendations to the NCAA membership \non how to allocate the $1 billion that CBS will begin paying next year for \nexclusive rights to the tournament. \n\n\n\"We would like to get back to the point where we play more for the trophy and \nless for the money,\" said Delaney. \"I think there is a recognition that we need \nto use the money to encourage broad-based programs and more academic programs.\" \n\n\nFairly certain is that the tournament will remain in its current 64-team format \nthrough 1997, when the CBS contract expires, because the broadcast rights were \nsold on that premise. \n\n\nIn all the good news talk of power ratings, strength of schedule and magic \nnumbers of wins and losses, Delaney did have one potentially ominous note for \nthe ACC. \n\n\nDelaney declined to speak specifically on Maryland's current NCAA problems and \nthe anticipated punishment, saying the school still is eligible for postseason \nplay. \n\n\nBut he did say that if a conference allows teams to participate in its \npostseason tournament where an NCAA bid is at stake, it runs the risk of \nforfeiting that bid if any of those teams wins the tournament. \n\n\n\"If that conference permits an ineligible institution to participate, and that \nteam wins, then the automatic bid is lost,\" said Delaney. \"It's as if they had \nforfeited the automatic bid.\" \n\n\nNorth Carolina State already has been banished from this year's tournament, and \nMaryland may be forced to sit out when the sanctions are announced, presumably \nwithin the next two weeks."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0112", "docId": "179802", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Business; Part D; Page 1; Column 2; Financial Desk", "length": "1033", "headline": "LIVE, FROM OUTER SPACE: A NEW UNIVERSE OF TELECAST POSSIBILITIES;", "byline": "By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": "Drawing, SATELLITE TRANSMISSION; JAMES OWENS / Los Angeles Times; Drawing, \nCABLE TELEVISION; JAMES OWENS / Los Angeles Times; Photo, PLINK, DOWNLINK: \nBRINGING PROGRAMS TO THE HOME: Sky Cable's compact, rectangular antenna, \nforeground, will receive high-definition TV signals via satellite. The expected \n$300 purchase price is a fraction of what a home satellite dish currently \ncosts. Hughes Communications photo", "text": "For some of us, a simple television set, capable of receiving just the free \nprogramming broadcast over the airwaves, will be enough to meet our at-home \nvideo entertain- \n\n\nment needs. \n\n\nBut we will be the techno-dinosaurs. \n\n\nAs Wednesday's announcement from four of the world's largest entertainment and \ntechnology companies underscores, yet more choices are on the horizon to entice \nwould-be dinosaurs into accepting additional programming into their TV sets. \n\n\nDirect broadcast satellite, or \"direct from outer space and into your home\" \nbroadcasting, is the latest service offering additional information and \nentertainment. Over the next two decades, there will be yet other services. \nThey include improved cable service, which is expected during the next few \nyears. Also possible are fiber optic broadcast lines, but these are not \nexpected to be commonly available into the home for at least 20 years because \nof the high cost of bringing the cable to the doorstep. \n\n\nWhich services will win out will depend largely on which can provide the best \nprogramming at the best price. Technology alone isn't the issue, some analysts \nsay. \n\n\n\"People don't watch fiber optics or satellites. They watch programs,\" said Paul \nMarsh, analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. \n\n\n\"The real business question is simply whether there is any demand for yet more \npay-to-view broadcast services, and whether that air time can be filled with \nquality programming,\" says Mitch Shapiro, a cable television analyst with Paul \nKagan Associates in San Diego. \n\n\nAlready it's clear that a growing number of Americans want more than just what \nis provided by conventional free network broadcasting. An estimated 45 million \nU.S. house- \n\n\nholds -- or nearly half of the total -- subscribe to cable television, \ngenerating about $13 billion a year in revenues for cable operators. Analysts \nestimate that by the end of 1992, 92% of the nation's households will have \naccess to cable television and 70 million will subscribe. \n\n\nWednesday's announcement demonstrates that at least four major companies -- the \nHughes Communications unit of General Motors, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., \nGeneral Electric's National Broadcasting Co. and Cablevision Systems Co. -- \nbelieve that there will be sufficient demand for more programming. \n\n\n\"The new service will give Americans a taste of the next century's boundless \nrange of video choices,\" said Stephen J. Petrucci, president and chief \noperating officer of Hughes Communications, which will provide the satellite \nsystem. \n\n\nShapiro says they may be right. Although direct broadcast satellite service was \ntried several years ago in the United States and was a colossal, expensive \nflop, Shapiro says the economics and technology of the business have changed \nsufficiently to give this service a chance. \n\n\nAccording to analysts, the costs of traditional lay-it-in-the-ground cable \nservice is rising as operators are being forced to replace old wiring and relay \nstations with more state-of-the-art devices. Further, attempts to get by with \nsimply extending the coverage of their existing equipment have prompted a \nflurry of customer complaints about service. That, along with concerns about \nhigh charges, has brought calls for re-regulation of the entire cable industry. \n\n\nAt the same time, the cost of satellite service has dropped. The proposed \nservice, called Sky Cable and scheduled for introduction in late 1993, plans to \nuse the most powerful space transmitter satellite ever launched for commercial \ncommunications, according to the companies' joint statement. \n\n\nThe high-power satellite system will make as many as 108 new channels available \nto receivers as small as a flat, napkin-sized dish that could be mounted on a \nwindow sill or roof top, the companies said. The receivers would cost about \n$300 and would be easily available at consumer electronics stores, the firms \nsaid. And Sky Cable operators say their monthly charge will be $25, about what \nthe average cable subscriber now pays. \n\n\nIn contrast, current satellite broadcasting services beam low-power signals \nthat require huge back-yard receivers -- often 12 feet in diameter -- to \nreceive them. These \"satellite dishes\" cost $2,000 to $3,000 and are banned in \nmany suburban communities as unsightly. \n\n\nBut if Sky Cable is a success, analysts say, you can bet that there will be \nother similar services. Already, the Federal Communications Commission has \nissued licenses for eight satellite broadcast systems. And traditional cable \noperators may be among those operating the satellite systems. \n\n\n\"Cable companies believe they are in the business of bringing entertainment to \npeople's homes. If that means by wire in the ground, fine. But if it means with \na satellite in the sky, that's what they will do, too,\" said one cable \nprogramming executive. \n\n\nSATELLITE TRANSMISSION \n\n\n1. Tevision programming is transmitted to a satellite. \n\n\n2. The satellite receives the programming. The satellites planned for Sky Cable \nare being billed as the most powerful space transmitters ever launched for \ncommercial communications purposes. \n\n\n3. A home with a satellite dish can pull in the television signal from the \nsatellite. Sky Cable will use a mini-dish the size of a dinner napkin and will \ncost about $300, the venture's participants say. Conventional dish antennas are \nabout 10 feet in diameter and can cost more than $3,000. As with most existing \ncable and satellite systems, a cable will run from the mini-dish to a decoder \non top of the television set. \n\n\nCABLE TELEVISION \n\n\n1. Programming of all types -- news, movies, sitcoms, sporting events -- is \ntransmitted to a satellite orbiting high above the earth. \n\n\n2. The satellite receives, sorts and amplifies the information, then transmits \nit back to a ground station. \n\n\n3. The television programs travel along cables to the homes of subscribers. The \ntelecommunications industry is moving toward the use of fiber-optic cable, \nwhich can carry its signals more quickly and with less interference than copper \nwire cable. \n\n\nThe local cable operator receives the signal on a large dish antenna and \nredistributes it to customers. The company schedules and promotes the shows and \nsigns up subscribers."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0113", "docId": "179803", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Business; Part D; Page 1; Column 6; Financial Desk", "length": "776", "headline": "SIMMONS TO OFFER HIS OWN SLATE FOR LOCKHEED'S BOARD", "byline": "By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "Harold C. Simmons, the Texas financier who has been challenging the management \nof Lockheed Corp., disclosed plans Wednesday to nominate his own slate of \ncandidates for the aerospace firm's board of directors. \n\n\nIn a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Simmons said he will \nsubmit a rival slate of candidates at Lockheed's annual shareholder meeting \nMarch 29. Simmons, who controls about 18.9% of Lockheed, said he will ask \nLockheed shareholders to reject the 15-member slate endorsed by Lockheed \nmanagement in favor of a rival group that he plans to name. To comply with \nLockheed's corporate bylaws, Simmons must identify his candidates by Monday. \n\n\nCalabasas, Calif.-based Lockheed had no comment on Simmons' filing, said Ron \nMeder, a company spokesman. However, Meder said Lockheed recently prepared for \nsuch a board challenge by retaining Kekst & Co., a New York-based \ncommunications consultant. \"In the event there is proxy contest at the meeting, \n(Kekst & Co.'s) expertise would be beneficial to us,\" Meder said. \n\n\nLockheed stock closed Thursday at $36 on the New York Stock Exchange, up $1.25. \n\n\nThe Simmons announcement is the latest in a series of maneuvers and \nconfrontations involving Lockheed and Simmons, chairman of the Dallas-based \nValhi Inc., a holding company with subsidiaries involved in the production of \nchemicals, petroleum and forest products. At stake is control of the nation's \neighth largest defense contractor. \n\n\nThe dispute erupted shortly after a Jan. 31 meeting between Simmons and \nLockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep. Simmons demanded six seats on Lockheed's \nboard, which consists of 15 directors, and asked the company's management to \neliminate a \"poison pill\" takeover defense that was erected after Simmons began \nbuying shares last year. Tellep refused to promise Simmons the seats and \nrejected proposals for eliminating the anti-takeover measures. \n\n\nThree days later, Simmons said he might seek control of Lockheed's board of \ndirectors by mounting a challenge at the company's annual meeting. Lockheed \nresponded last week, surprising much of the financial world by scheduling the \nannual meeting for March 29. In recent years, Lockheed has held its annual \nmeeting in May. \n\n\nThe scheduling forced Simmons' hand because Lockheed shareholders are required \nto make any board nominations within 10 days of the public announcement of a \nmeeting date. \n\n\nInstead of methodically planning a board slate and a strategy for winning \nshareholder support in May, Simmons will now have to scramble to prepare for a \nMarch meeting, industry analysts said. \n\n\n\"Lockheed moved up the date to force Simmons to act immediately,\" said Howard \nMager, an analyst at New York-based Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. \"They \nforced him (Simmons) to move.\" \n\n\nHowever, Michael Snetzer, president of Simmons-controlled Valhi, said Simmons \nwould select a board slate within the required time. A subsidiary of Valhi \nholds the 18.9% stake, the largest single block of Lockheed shares. Snetzer \nsaid Simmons decided to field a slate because he could not get a voice on the \nLockheed board. \n\n\n\"We own almost 20% of the stock in (Lockheed) and we think its appropriate to \nhave representation,\" he said. \"We're unhappy with the fact that we've been \ndenied representation.\" \n\n\nLockheed spokesman Meder repeated a statement that Lockheed Chairman Tellep \nmade Feb. 2 after Simmons indicated that he might launch a proxy fight for \nshareholders' votes to oust board members. \n\n\nTellep's statement said in part that Simmons offered no plans or proposals for \nLockheed and \"provided no basis whatsoever for us to determine his intentions \nwith respect to the company or whether his interests would be consistent with \nthose of Lockheed and its other shareholders.\" \n\n\nIn recent months, Simmons steadily has increased his holdings in Lockheed, \ndeveloper of the Stealth fighter plane, from 6.25% last fall to 18.9% two weeks \nago. \n\n\nLockheed produces some of the nation's most advanced weapons systems. However, \nlike all arms makers, it is trying to deal with declining sales and tougher \ncontracting terms imposed by the Pentagon. Some analysts say investors will be \nsearching for a new vision for financial growth from Simmons and Lockheed \nexecutives in the wake of declining East-West tensions and the prospect of \nsmaller defense budgets. \n\n\n\"I want to hear what Simmons has to say,\" said Howard Rubel, an analyst at C. \nJ. Lawrence. \"If he wants credibility, he will have to come to the street and \npreach his gospel. It's incumbent on both sides to articulate strategy and a \nfallback strategy as to how Lockheed can become a better company over the next \ntwo to five years.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0114", "docId": "179804", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Business; Part D; Page 1; Column 6; Financial Desk", "length": "820", "headline": "AIR FORCE LIED ABOUT B-1 COSTS, GAO STUDY SAYS;", "byline": "By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "The Air Force understated its cost on the B-1 bomber by $7.5 billion and on two \nother aircraft programs by an additional $18 billion, according to a draft \nGeneral Accounting Office report that found that the Air Force's accounting \npractices have \"significant internal control weaknesses.\" \n\n\nThe GAO disclosed, for example, that when the Air Force Space Division in Los \nAngeles found a $2.4-billion discrepancy in its accounting books, it simply \nmade an \"unsupported and arbitrary\" adjustment to get the books to balance. \n\n\nThe controversial report, which was the culmination of a three-year \ninvestigation, elicited a sharply worded statement by the Air Force, which \"had \nserious disagreements with the content of the draft report and the handling of \nthe audit. GAO's findings are fundamentally misdirected.\" \n\n\nBut some members of Congress reacted with outrage to the findings and vowed to \nhold hearings to develop new laws to strengthen the government's financial \nmanagement. Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), whose staff obtained and leaked an \nexecutive summary of the unpublished draft report, said the findings \"would be \nunbelieveable had we not seen firsthand the chaos in Air Force management.\" \n\n\nA number of the GAO disclosures are sure to prompt serious concerns throughout \nCongress, including the disclosure about the cost for 100 B-1 bombers. The \nreport states that the cost of the bomber was represented as $23 billion, but \nthe actual cost was $7.5 billion more. If that is confirmed, it would mean the \nB-1 exceeded the cost cap that the Pentagon guaranteed to Congress. \n\n\nIn addition, the report said the F-15 jet fighter cost was understated by $8.3 \nbillion and the F-16 was understated by $9.9 billion. The gaps are even wider \nwhen research and development is included, it said. \n\n\nOne specific problem is the service's failure to track military-owned hardware \nthat is held by defense contractors. For example, $630 million worth of \nsatellites paid for by the Air Force but in the possession of defense \ncontractors were \"not recorded in any Air Force property or accounting system,\" \nthe report said. \n\n\nThe report by the GAO, which is an investigatory arm of Congress, was titled \n\"Financial Management -- Billion Dollar Decisions Made Using Inaccurate and \nUnreliable Air Force Data.\" The GAO assigned hundreds of its auditors to the \nmassive project. \n\n\nAn Air Force spokeswoman said the service received the report Feb. 1 and has \nnot had time to respond to specific allegations. In a lengthy rebuttal, \nhowever, the service claimed the GAO attempted to apply accounting principles \nused by profit-making corporations. It said the GAO concept for accounting \"has \nnot been accepted by the Congress or the executive branch.\" \n\n\nThe statement added that the report fails to recognize the Air Force's \"fund \ncontrol system\" used to report on the status of its funds to Congress. And the \nstatement concludes, \"The GAO report creates a faulty impression of waste and \nmismanagement. That perception is simply not true.\" The Defense Department may \nbe less inclined to object to the GAO findings or to future reforms, according \nto a knowledgeable source. Longtime internal Air Force critic A. Ernest \nFitzgerald, remarked, \"Missing a few billion dollars? What the hell.\" \n\n\nFitzgerald, the management systems deputy in the Office of the Assistant \nSecretary of the Air Force for financial management, has railed for years that \nthe defense procurement system has a \"weakness in our protections against \ncollusive fraud.\" He charged that what few internal checks and balances existed \nin the Pentagon's financial system were watered down by the Packard Commission \nreforms, implemented in an executive directive in 1986. \n\n\nJulian Epstein, the staff director for the House Government Operations \nCommittee, said, \"If the report is true, it indicates very serious problems in \nthe Air Force in terms of wasting billions of taxpayers dollars.\" The \ncommittee, along with Dingell's powerful Committee on Energy and Commerce and \nthe House Armed Services Committee, may hold hearings. \n\n\nIn a letter, Dingell said the $2.4-billion accounting error committed by the \nAir Force Space Division is \"five times the entire drug abuse education budget \nof the U.S. government.\" Dingell called for a 10% to 15% cut in the Pentagon \nacquisition budget. \n\n\nThe GAO found that when the Air Force recently submitted financial reports to \nthe Treasury it neglected to include $25 billion in assets and counted $10 \nbillion in other assets twice. \n\n\nThe service lacks accurate data for \"almost all of its non-cash assets, such as \ninventory, equipment, aircraft and missiles,\" despite the fact that its bases \nrepresent 16% of the real property of the entire U.S. government, the GAO said. \n\n\nIt noted that the Air Logistics Centers, which hold inventories of spare parts, \nhave record-keeping deficiencies that \"contribute to $18 billion of inventory \nin excess of requirements.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0115", "docId": "179811", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Business; Part D; Page 2; Column 1; Financial Desk", "length": "73", "headline": "BRIEFLY", "byline": "From Times Staff and Wire Service Reports", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "Digital May Post Its First Loss: Acknowledging that the slump in the computer \nindustry has hurt business, Digital Equipment Corp. of Maynard, Mass., said it \nmay report the first quarterly loss in its 32-year history.

That threw cold \nwater on Japanese hopes that lower American interest rates might help lead to \nlower Japanese interest rates. \n\n\nIronically, the market was primed for bad news by Sunday's good news -- for \ninvestors -- that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party had won a convincing \nvictory in elections for the lower house of Parliament. There had been \nwidespread fear that the central bank had been postponing a rise in the \ninterest rate it charges on loans to commercial banks until after the elections \nin order to bolster the ruling party's fortunes at the polls. \n\n\nIndeed, when trading opened Monday, stock prices declined instead of increasing \nas they usually do when the Liberal Democrats win an election. \n\n\nOn Wednesday, continuing fears ignited the selloff of national government \nbonds, forcing the Finance Ministry to step in with purchases to prop up prices \nin the morning. Then, an hour before closing, institutional investors began \ndumping large lots of stocks amid light trading, spurring a final-hour plunge. \n\n\nAmerican-style computer-directed program trading -- which takes advantage of a \ngap between current prices and prices of stocks for delivery in the future, a \ntrading strategy not followed here in 1987 -- was blamed in part for the \nplunge. \n\n\nBonds rebounded sharply as stocks fell. \n\n\nInstitutional investors reportedly sold stocks to avoid further losses that \nthey feared they would have to list when they settle accounts March 31, the end \nof Japan's fiscal year."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0123", "docId": "179831", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Metro; Part B; Page 1; Column 2; Metro Desk", "length": "1043", "headline": "BENNETT HAS A HUG FOR NEIGHBORHOOD PLAGUED BY DRUGS", "byline": "By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, Drug czar William Bennett and Police Chief Daryl Gates are hugged by \nchildren on 40th Place.

Hill, who has spent 50 of his 91 years in the crowded blue-collar \nneighborhood near Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, did a spry little dance \nthere Wednesday on 40th Place, a street plagued by drug sales and gang gunfire. \n\n\nWearing a ball cap and tennis shoes, Hill was looking excited and optimistic on \na block that had been, to some extent, under siege. \n\n\nA few weeks ago, responding to repeated drive-by shootings, Los Angeles police \nbegan six months of stepped-up, 24-hour patrols of the neighborhood. \nResidential streets were barricaded with warning signs: \"Narcotics Enforcement \nArea: Open to Residents Only.\" \n\n\nNow, in an atmosphere of calm, Hill had stepped out to welcome a newcomer to \nthe block -- federal drug czar William J. Bennett, making one of his first \nstops on a three-day visit to Southern California. \n\n\n\"It's going to do some good,\" Hill said happily. \"This is what we need. You can \nnever stop trying.\" \n\n\nBennett, who met with teachers, parents and students at Jefferson High before \ntouring the racially mixed neighborhood, was on his first trip to Los Angeles \nsince the Bush Administration designated the Los Angeles-Orange County region a \n\"high-intensity\" drug trafficking center in January. \n\n\nUnder the new anti-drug strategy, Los Angeles and four other targeted areas -- \nHouston, Miami, New York and the U.S.-Mexican border -- qualify to share $25 \nmillion this year in special federal funds to combat the drug problem, and \ntwice that much in 1991. \n\n\nBennett, a graying, tousle-haired administrator nearing the end of his first \nyear as federal drug czar, spent much of Wednesday meeting with state, city and \ncounty officials to hear their ideas about anti-drug tactics and to brief them \non the federal program. \n\n\nBut, playing a favorite role as cheerleader and first-hand observer, he also \ntook time to look at the problems of a particular neighborhood. In choosing the \narea surrounding Jefferson High, the nation's top drug official sought a place \nthat has been hard hit by drugs and related crime -- and a place that is doing \nsomething about it, according to Bennett's aides. \n\n\n\"This is another foray for me into the heart of America,\" Bennett told a crowd \nof several dozen residents from a lectern placed in the middle of 40th Place. \nTraffic was blocked off by police cars while mounted LAPD officers rode past \nhomes like figures out of the Old West. \n\n\nThe street is home to a Latino gang -- Crazy Street Kids -- which reportedly \nhas been feuding with a gang to the south known as the 33rd Street Gang, said \nSang Brown, a block captain of the local Neighborhood Watch program. \n\n\nThere have been eight attempted drive-by shootings reported on 40th Place in \nthe last 18 months, according to Brown. Around the high school, located down \nthe block, there were 37 drive-by shootings and 112 assaults last year, police \nsaid. \n\n\nBennett described 40th Place as a tough neighborhood in a tough region -- \nnoting that 47 gangs inhabit 10 square miles of South-Central Los Angeles. \n\n\n\"And yet progress is being made (here),\" Bennett said. \"This community is \nstarting to turn itself around. Everybody I've talked to said it's better. You \ncan walk the streets now.\" \n\n\nThe LAPD barricade program, nicknamed \"Operation Cul-De-Sac,\" is given much of \nthe credit -- along with community Neighborhood Watch groups -- for \ndiscouraging drug dealing and drive-by attacks. \n\n\nThe six-month program is designed to make it more difficult for dealers and \ngang members to drive through residential areas. In its first two weeks, police \nsaid, the program has contributed to a decrease in crime and, at the same time, \nan increase in daily attendance at 2,590-student Jefferson High. \n\n\n\"One of the most striking things I've ever heard, I heard today,\" Bennett told \nresidents after a closed-door meeting with school Principal Philip Saldivar. \n\"And that's that 150 to 200 more students are back in school\" during the day. \n\n\nSome residents are concerned, however, over what might happen once the program \nends. Asked whether drug dealers and gang shooters will renew their attacks, \nBennett optimistically called for homeowners to take over a part of the burden \nof patrolling their street and reporting crime. \n\n\n\"You never entirely remove the police,\" Bennett said. \"But the responsibility \nmay pass on to other people.\" \n\n\nRather than rely on several policemen, he said, patrols may be taken over by \n\"three or four civilians, with a policeman down the block. That's one way to do \nit.\" \n\n\n\"Drug dealers . . . run from a policeman,\" he added. \"They also run from a \nflashlight. They run from a neighbor with a bullhorn. Someone told me drug \ndealers behave like roaches -- you put the light on them and they run.\" \n\n\nOne resident, however, described that outlook as overly optimistic. Calvin \nWills, who has watched the neighborhood deteriorate over 20 years, said the \nstepped-up patrols have come too late. And once they end, he said, crime will \ncreep in again. \n\n\n\"With a show of force like this, naturally things are going to slow down,\" \nWills said. \"(But) the people committing the crime, they'll know the exact \nsecond the police leave. Then they'll start all over again.\" Pausing, he added: \n\"Maybe it won't be as much as in the past.\" \n\n\nBennett, however, seemed to win points from residents with his enthusiasm and \ngood humor. Lumbering around the block with an entourage of police and county \ngang specialists, Bennett and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates stopped \nto hug the children of one resident who rushed out to see them. Later, Bennett \ntook a long-handled roller to help a painting crew cover gang slogans scrawled \non a block wall. \n\n\nBennett, who was scheduled to continue his West Coast tour with a stop today in \nSan Diego, is mindful of Los Angeles' importance to the anti-drug effort, said \nDavid Robb, a spokesman in Washington. \n\n\nThe region is considered a leading port of entry and trading center for not \nonly cocaine but also PCP and Mexican and Asian heroin, Robb said. A recent \nstudy also disclosed that the average selling price for cocaine is lower in Los \nAngeles than any other place in the nation -- $11,000 to $16,000 a kilogram, he \nsaid. \n\n\n\"It's a bit worrisome,\" Robb said. \"That's one of the reasons we designated \nL.A.\" as a drug trafficking center."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0124", "docId": "179832", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Metro; Part B; Page 1; Column 2; Metro Desk", "length": "871", "headline": "JUDGE POUNDERS IS TAKEN OFF BUCKEY'S RETRIAL;", "byline": "By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, Judge William R.

Pounders, who presided over the \nrecord-breaking McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, was barred Wednesday \nfrom hearing the retrial of defendant Ray Buckey because of remarks the judge \nmade after Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted last \nmonth of 52 counts. \n\n\nSuperior Court Judge Michael Hoff, who evaluated the defense's claim of bias, \nsaid in a written recommendation that, although he found no evidence that \nPounders was prejudiced against Buckey or his lawyer, the case should be \nreassigned to another judge to avoid potential conflicts of interest during \njury selection. \n\n\n\"Both the prosecution and the defense would want to know if a prospective juror \nsaw or heard any of the post-trial broadcasts that involved Judge Pounders and \nif so, what effect, if any, that would have on the prospective juror's capacity \nto be impartial,\" Hoff wrote. \n\n\n\"Judge Pounders may very well be forced into the position of ruling on a \nchallenge for cause by either the prosecution or defense and would, in effect, \nbe ruling on his own actions that were taken during the post-trial publicity.\" \n\n\nHoff did not specify what Pounders had said that might influence a potential \njuror. \n\n\nAfter Hoff's recommendation, Judge Gary Klausner, presiding judge of the \nSuperior Court's central criminal division, announced that he had decided to \nassign to a different judge Buckey's March 9 retrial on the 13 counts on which \nthe earlier jury deadlocked. That choice will be announced Monday. \n\n\nDefense attorney Danny Davis called the ruling \"a good decision,\" and his \nclient agreed. \n\n\n\"I'm very happy with the ruling,\" said Buckey, 31, who is free on his own \nrecognizance. \"It concerned me that he (Pounders) had gone public and made a \nlot of statements people might misinterpret.\" \n\n\nHowever, he added, \"I thought there was justice in the first trial. . . . Now \nwe're going to go for justice again, for total acquittal, and put this thing to \nrest finally.\" \n\n\nDistrict attorney's spokesperson Sandi Gibbons said the prosecution \"respects \nJudge Hoff's ruling. Our concern is to try to bring this case to trial as soon \nas possible. We're ready to go.\" \n\n\nThe removal of Pounders could delay the start of the trial, depending on how \nmuch preparation time the new judge feels is necessary. \n\n\nPounders said afterward that he felt both \"relief that I'm finally free\" to \nchannel his energies elsewhere, but also \"disappointment\" that he will not be \nthe judge to take the case to its conclusion. \n\n\nHe said he had appeared on at least 12 news programs after the verdicts because \nhe felt it was important to explain why the trial took nearly three years and \nto defend the jury against public reaction. \n\n\nFollowing the first trial, Pounders made himself available to the local and \nnational media and made the talk show circuit -- including \"Nightline,\" \"Oprah \nWinfrey,\" \"Geraldo,\" \"The Today Show,\" and \"Good Morning America.\" \n\n\nThe judge discussed the significance of videotaped interviews with the alleged \nchild victims that the jury, but not the public, saw, and the impact of earlier \ninterviews on the children's later trial testimony. He also talked repeatedly \nabout the system of justice as one \"that is set up to allow guilty people to go \nfree\" rather than to risk convicting the innocent. \n\n\nBut the judge maintained that, \"I don't think anything I said would affect the \nmerits of the second trial and I didn't see any problem in selecting a second \njury.\" \n\n\nHowever, Pounders said the stress and strain of the long trial had left him \nexhausted. He said he broke a molar while clenching his teeth and often took \nhis frustrations out on his family, rather than allow them to surface in court. \n\n\n\"I was honestly afraid I wouldn't live through it,\" he said. \"I never saw a \ndoctor. I didn't want to know. I had literally committed my life to the case.\" \n\n\nDavis had alleged that Pounders had demonstrated bias during the trial, which \nPounders vehemently denied. The defense attorney cited the judge having called \nhim \"an ass,\" his slashing of the defense witness roster, his exclusion of some \nevidence, his refusal to pay all defense costs, and his vow to conclude the \ntrial \"even if it's over your dead body\" as evidence of prejudice. \n\n\nBut Pounders countered that the defense had consumed the majority of trial \ntime, and had submitted \"excessive\" or unauthorized claims for financial \nreimbursement. \n\n\nAfter reading written arguments from both sides, Hoff determined that \"the \npapers and videotape submitted by (the defense) and the gross allegations \ncontained therein did not cause me to find Judge Pounders was prejudiced \nagainst Mr. Davis or Mr. Buckey in the trial that recently concluded. The 52 \n'not guilty' verdicts tend to support this view.\" \n\n\nHowever, he added, while there was \"a need to explain the court's function\" to \n\"an irate community,\" and that \"the judge did just that,\" such activities would \ncreate a problem in jury selection for both the prosecution and the defense. \n\n\nThe tone of the first trial was frequently hostile and tense. But everyone was \nsmiling Wednesday when Davis and Buckey stopped by Pounders' courtroom. The \njudge shook hands with them and wished Buckey \"good luck.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0125", "docId": "179833", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Metro; Part B; Page 2; Column 2; Metro Desk", "length": "154", "headline": "METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY MOVES TO ENFORCE PROPOSED POLICE PACT", "byline": null, "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "Unable to forge a new labor contract with the Long Beach Police Officers Assn., \nLong Beach city officials said Wednesday that they have begun taking steps to \nenforce the provisions of their last contract offer in the 642-member Police \nDepartment. \n\n\nA state appeals court this week refused the police union's request for a stay \nthat would have barred the city from implementing the contract offer while the \nunion appeals a Superior Court decision. \n\n\nThat ruling allowed the city to declare an impasse in police negotiations and \nadopt the work rules spelled out in its last offer without the consent of the \nunion. \n\n\nUnder the new work rules, the union president loses paid release time from \nregular police duties, some nighttime police patrols will be changed from \ntwo-officer cars to one-officer cars, and some officers will be reassigned from \nfour-day work weeks of 10-hour days to conventional five-day work weeks."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0126", "docId": "179834", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Metro; Part B; Page 2; Column 1; Metro Desk", "length": "157", "headline": "METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FAMILIES OF SUSPECTS IN HOLDUP SUE FOR $10 \nMILLION", "byline": null, "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "The families of robbery suspects killed by Los Angeles police and a fourth man \nwho was wounded after a holdup at a Sunland McDonald's restaurant filed a \n$10-million lawsuit Wednesday charging that the officers used excessive force \nand murdered the three men. \n\n\nThe lawsuit was filed against the city, Mayor Tom Bradley, Police Chief Daryl \nF.

LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "Claiming that her family's religious rights have been violated, a Los Angeles \nJewish woman received a one-day restraining order Wednesday blocking an autopsy \non her father, who died last week from injuries suffered during a mugging. \n\n\nThe children of Paul Reznek, who died Feb. 14 at the age of 83, said that the \ncounty medical examiner's handling of their father's case already has prevented \nan immediate burial as is called for by Jewish law. \n\n\nIn the request for a restraining order, Reznek's daughter also argued that the \nautopsy is unnecessary because, she said, authorities have expressed doubts \nover whether there will be a criminal trial in the case. There are no suspects \nand police say the chances of finding one are slim, said the daughter, Dorothy \nReznek, 40. \n\n\nMinutes before the 12:30 p.m. autopsy was scheduled to begin, Los Angeles \nCounty Superior Court Judge David Yaffe issued the temporary restraining order \non the grounds that incisions made during the examination might violate \nreligious guidelines about desecration of the dead and that a forensic \nexamination is not likely to produce significant new findings, according to \nReznek's son, Phillip. \n\n\nThe final decision on whether to conduct the autopsy will be made at a hearing \nscheduled for today. Until the matter is decided the body will be held at a \nlocal funeral home. \n\n\nDeputy County Counsel Richard Townsend, the attorney representing the medical \nexaminer's office, said he has not heard of any other case in which a \nrestraining order based on religious reasons prevented the autopsy of a \nhomicide victim. \n\n\nThe medical examiner's office has insisted that the autopsy is necessary in the \nevent that a suspect in the case is found. Because Reznek apparently died of \ncomplications from injuries he suffered during the mugging, charges in the \ncrime could include murder, the attorney said. \n\n\nWithout an autopsy report, prosecutors probably will not have enough evidence \nto charge Reznek's assailant with murder, Townsend said. \n\n\nBut family members said that the medical records kept from the day of the \nassault clearly show the connection between a hip injury that Reznek suffered \nin the incident and his death. Reznek had been hospitalized since the attack on \nDec. 12, 1989. \n\n\nReznek was mugged in downtown Los Angeles while returning to his Westside home \nafter unsuccessfully trying to buy a monthly bus pass. He was thrown to the \nground, and his assailant took a wallet with credit cards, traveler's checks \nand cash, authorities said. \n\n\nThe impact of Reznek's fall broke his left hip, authorities said. He underwent \nan operation and, although his condition had stabilized somewhat, he and his \nfamily felt that death was imminent, Dorothy Reznek said. \n\n\nBefore Paul Reznek died, he and his family raised objections to an autopsy and \na religious waiver form was filed with the medical examiner, the daughter said. \n\n\nThe family was told that the body would be released after a brief \"physical \nexamination\" and that no incisions would be made, she said. \n\n\n\"All along the detectives had been strongly recommending that an autopsy be \nconducted,\" Dorothy Reznek said. But after reviewing hospital records, police \ndetectives agreed with the family that the autopsy was unnecessary. \n\n\n\"The evening my father died, the police investigators told me that a sufficient \n'paper trail' based on doctors' reports would provide everything that an \nautopsy would provide,\" she added. \n\n\nFamily members also have expressed concerns about how the police investigation \ninto the mugging was handled. Dorothy Reznek claimed that a cursory initial \ninvestigation into the robbery has reduced the likelihood of finding a suspect. \nPolice did not interview her father, she said. \n\n\n\"I have no hope that they will ever find anyone, or that true justice will be \nserved in this case,\" she said. \n\n\nGiven the problems with the case, Reznek said, the coroner's interest in \npursuing the autopsy for the sake of bringing Reznek's assailant to justice is \nall the more frustrating. \n\n\n\"The (coroner's officials) seem to have completely lost sight that there was a \nhuman being involved here at one point.

Just \none was marred by violence, a Dec. 10 clash between UNO and Sandinista \nmilitants that left one man dead at a UNO rally in Masatepe. \n\n\nSome leaders of the 14-party coalition have complained of a \"silent campaign\" \nof Sandinista intimidation against their candidates and poll-watchers. \nChamorro's chief strategist, Alfredo Cesar, charged Wednesday that the \nSandinistas have abused their control of the media, public transport and the \nstate bureaucracy to wage a \"tremendously unfair campaign.\" \n\n\nSuch grievances have been echoed by the Bush Administration throughout the \ncampaign as a basis for questioning whether free and fair elections are \npossible here. \n\n\nWhile reporting extensively on these complaints, both official observer \nmissions, from the United Nations and the Organization of American States, have \npresented a more favorable picture of the campaign. \n\n\n\"The difficulties that have arisen for the most part have been overcome,\" the \nOAS secretary general, Joao Baena Soares, concluded in a pre-election report \nissued Wednesday. \"It is expected that the elections will take place in a \nclimate that permits citizens to choose freely.\" \n\n\nAll assessments of the campaign agree that the Sandinistas, who fought their \nway to power a decade ago and turned their guerrilla army into a powerful \npolitical machine, hold the incumbent's edge over a fragile and emerging \nopposition. But several disparities raise the question of fairness: \n\n\n -- News broadcasts on the state television monopoly gave far more time to \nOrtega than his challengers. The state-owned Voice of Nicaragua radio network \nstretched the limits of objectivity by offering prizes such as cars and houses \nto listeners who correctly predict Ortega's margin of victory. Under criticism \nfrom observer groups, the government expanded free TV time set aside for debate \namong candidates. Baena Soares' report said television news coverage was more \nbalanced at the end of the campaign but still gave the Sandinistas more time. \n\n\n -- Army trucks and other state-owned vehicles were routinely used to transport \npeople to Ortega rallies, while government buildings were festooned with red \nand black Sandinista banners and wall paintings, in violation of the electoral \nlaw. \n\n\n\"They fly the Sandinista flag from an army barracks near my office,\" said \nGuillermo Selva, an opposition member of the electoral council that is assigned \nto enforce the law. \"I asked the army 20 times to remove it, but they just \nignored me.\" \n\n\nBaena Soares said the government had shrugged off such appeals, even those made \nformally by the council. Nor has the government produced the receipts to back \nits claim that the Sandinista Party rents its trucks from the government. \n\n\nEven so, he said in an interview, \"the use of public facilities (by the \ngovernment party) happens to some degree in every country. It's not a threat to \nthis election.\" \n\n\n -- The Sandinistas outspent the opposition while delaying delivery, through \nthe Central Bank, of $3.3 million voted by the U.S. Congress to help Chamorro \noffset the Sandinistas' advantages. Those funds reached her coalition in late \nJanuary, more than a month after they were deposited here -- a delay caused, in \npart, by UNO's failure to legally register an institute receiving part of the \nmoney. \n\n\nWhile the $3.3 million made up the bulk of UNO's campaign budget, the \nSandinistas reported spending $6.4 million, including $3 million in materials \nand $419,000 in cash donated from sympathizers abroad and the rest in corporate \nand individual contributions at home. UNO's estimate of Sandinista expenses \nruns up to $12 million. \n\n\nMariano Fiallos, president of the electoral council, noted that UNO fared \nrelatively well compared to the other eight opposition parties, none of which \nreceived more than $250,000. \n\n\n -- Sixty-eight candidates for the National Assembly and 243 candidates for \nmunicipal councils resigned during the campaign. Most represented UNO, which \nclaimed they were threatened by state security police and other Sandinista \nmilitants with loss of their lives, jobs or property. \n\n\nBaena Soares endorsed the finding of an earlier U.N. investigation that such \ncases did not suggest a pattern of intimidation centrally planned by the \nSandinista government but rather were the work of local party members. He said \nhis investigation was hampered by the failure of opposition parties to offer \nevidence of intimidation in most of the cases. \n\n\n\"It's fair to say that there is a wide discrepancy between the prevalence of \nthese charges and the production of any evidence of such actual intimidation,\" \nsaid former U.S. Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson, head of the U.N. mission \nwatching the elections. \n\n\nNoting that U.S.-backed Contras have attacked and killed at least four \nSandinista campaign workers, Baena Soares branded the rebels as \"the principal \nform of electoral violence.\" \n\n\nDespite claims that its poll watchers were threatened, UNO reported this week \nthat it had fielded poll watchers for all but seven of the nation's 4,391 \npolling stations, a critical step in monitoring the vote. \n\n\nSome observer groups are more critical than the U.N. and OAS missions of the \nSandinistas' campaign conduct. But all observers agree that the election itself \nwill have enough safeguards and international scrutiny to ensure a relatively \nfair count. \n\n\n\"I do not feel the campaign has gone well,\" said Allen Weinstein, head of the \nWashington-based Center for Democracy observer group. \"But if I felt the \ncampaign were so badly flawed that it wouldn't matter what happened on election \nday, I'd strike my tent and go home.\" \n\n\nOpposition parties have reached the same conclusion. Because the main U.S.- \nbacked anti-Sandinista coalition spoiled the 1984 election by pulling out, it \nis a notable event in Nicaragua's violent history that the contending forces \nare staying in this time."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0132", "docId": "179852", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Part A; Page 1; Column 2; Metro Desk", "length": "1349", "headline": "BONNIE RAITT, MIDLER WIN TOP GRAMMYS", "byline": "By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, COLOR, Bonnie Raitt, who won for best album, accepts 1 of 4 Grammys. \nRANDY LEFFINGWELL / Los Angeles Times; Photo, Bette Midler took best-record \naward for \"Wind Beneath My Wings.\" ; Photo, Public Enemy's Flavor Flav, left, \nsalutes rap winner Young M.C. JAYNE KAMIN-ONCEA / Los Angeles Times", "text": "Bonnie Raitt, whose career seemed in jeopardy four years ago when she was \ndropped by her long-time record company, climaxed a dramatic comeback Wednesday \nnight by winning a Grammy for best album of the year. \n\n\nRaitt, who also won three other Grammys during the nationally televised \nceremony at the Shrine Auditorium, has long been admired in the record industry \nfor her fierce devotion to the blues, including championing veteran artists \nwhose accomplishments have been sometimes overlooked by the pop world. \n\n\n\"This means so much for the kind of music that we do,\" the red-haired singer \nsaid in accepting the best-album award. \"It means that those of us who do \nrhythm and blues are going to get a chance again.\" \n\n\nIn the other key awards, Bette Midler's \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" was named best \nsingle record of 1989 and the composition itself, written by Larry Henley and \nJeff Silbar, was declared song of the year. \n\n\nThe Grammy awards are determined by the approximately 6,000 active members of \nthe National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences. \n\n\nNot only did Raitt, the 40-year-old daughter of Broadway singer John Raitt, \ncome up in 1989 with her most successful album ever, \"Nick of Time,\" she also \novercame in recent years a drinking problem that led her to Alcoholics \nAnonymous. \n\n\nDelighted by the response to the new album last October, she said in an \ninterview at the time, \"In many ways, this is like a first album. . . . It's \nfor a new label (Capitol) and getting all of this attention and critical \nacclaim \n\n\n\"And it's my first sober album. . . . Being this age and being straight -- it's \nbeen the greatest time.\" \n\n\nIn accepting the best-record Grammy, the evening's other most coveted award, \nMidler said, \"I'm stunned and I'm flabbergasted. \n\n\n\"Hey, Bonnie Raitt, I got one, too.\" \n\n\nBesides Raitt, other multiple winners Wednesday included jazz great Miles \nDavis, British soul-dance group Soul II Soul, composer-arranger Dave Grusin and \ncountry music's Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. \n\n\nDavis, who was also saluted with a prestigious lifetime achievement award, \npicked up his fifth and sixth career Grammys for best jazz instrumental \nperformance by a big band and by a soloist. \n\n\nSoul II Soul won Grammys for R&B group vocal award and R&B \ninstrumental. The group, however, lost in the more prized category of best new \nartist to the duo Milli Vanilli. \n\n\nGrusin, winner of three previous Grammys, picked up three more, including one \nfor the background score of the film \"The Fabulous Baker Boys.\" \n\n\nThe Nitty Gritty Dirt Band won a Grammy for best group vocal and shared a \nGrammy with Bruce Hornsby for best bluegrass recording. \n\n\nThe evening's most potentially dramatic moment -- the much rumored reunion of \nthe surviving Beatles -- failed to materialize because neither George Harrison \nnor Ringo Starr attended the event, though both were nominated for Grammys. \n\n\nThat left just Paul McCartney, who was also saluted by the Academy with a \nlifetime achievement award. McCartney, currently on his first U.S. tour in more \nthan a decade, thanked his wife, Linda, and their children for their support, \ngave a brief environment awareness message and described his former band mates \nas \"beautiful people.\" \n\n\nThe absent Harrison won a Grammy for best rock group vocal as a member of the \nTraveling Wilburys, the veteran rock group that also featured Bob Dylan, Jeff \nLynne, Tom Petty and the late Roy Orbison. But the Wilburys lost to Raitt in \nthe best-album competition. \n\n\nStarr was nominated in the country vocal collaboration category for a duet with \nBuck Owens, but also lost. \n\n\nRaitt's other Grammys were for female pop vocal, female rock vocal and \ntraditional blues recording. The latter was for her duet with John Lee Hooker \non \"I'm in the Mood,\" a track from Hooker's album, \"The Healer.\" \n\n\nMetallica's \"One\" was named best rock/metal recording, while Living Colour's \n\"Cult of Personality\" single was named best hard rock performance of 1989. \nLiving Colour's victory shut out the controversial Los Angeles-based hard-rock \nband Guns N' Roses. \n\n\nThe latter group had been widely criticized for allegedly racist remarks in a \nsong, \"One in a Million,\" that was included in its \"GN'R Lies\" album, which was \na contender in the hard-rock category. \n\n\nAbout 10 members from the Los Angeles chapter of the Guardian Angels, the \nself-styled crime fighters, marched in front of the Shrine on Wednesday, \nhanding out leaflets that branded \"One in a Million\" as racist for its use of \nracial epithets and New York rap group Public Enemy's \"Welcome to the \nTerrordome\" as anti-Semitic. \n\n\nPublic Enemy -- whose \"Fight the Power\" single lost in the rap category to \nYoung M.C.'s \"Bust a Move\" -- has been criticized by Jewish leaders and others \nfor possible anti-Semitic attitudes ever since a controversial interview by \nProfessor Griff, the group's former \"minister of information,\" that appeared \nlast May in the Washington Times. \n\n\nBoth Axl Rose, the lead singer of Guns N' Roses, and Chuck D., the leader of \nPublic Enemy, have denied racist or bigoted attitudes. \n\n\nMichael Bolton won best male pop vocalist for his recording \"How Am I Supposed \nto Live Without You,\" with the pop duo award going to Linda Ronstadt and Aaron \nNeville. \n\n\nFormer Eagle Don Henley was judged best male rock vocalist. \n\n\nThe video awards were strictly a family affair. Michael Jackson won in the \nshort-form music video category as his younger sister, Janet, triumphed in the \nlong-form music video competition. \n\n\nThe Winans family teamed up for three indvidual Grammys in the gospel \nballoting. \n\n\nHarry Connick Jr.'s victory in the male jazz vocal category is likely to stir \ncriticism from the purist wing of the jazz community that has tended to think \nof Connick primarily as a cabaret or pop singer. \n\n\nTwo names more commonly associated with pop and rock, Dr. John and Rickie Lee \nJones, were also honored for best jazz vocal by a duo or group. \n\n\nVeteran Ruth Brown, a star over the years in the R&B and rock fields, was \nnamed best female jazz vocalist for her album, \"Blues on Broadway.\" \n\n\nBobby Brown and Anita Baker were named best male and female R&B vocalists. \n\n\nIn the country field, k.d. lang was named best female singer for the second \nstraight year, while Lyle Lovett's victory in the male singer category ended a \nthree-year win streak for Randy Travis. \n\n\nLos Lobos was judged the best Mexican-American performance, while Jose \nFeliciano was cited as best Latin pop record. \n\n\nCelia Cruz and Ray Barretto shared the best tropical Latin performance award, \nwhile Ziggy Marley captured the reggae Grammy for the second straight year. \n\n\nThe late actress-comedian Gilda Radner was honored for best spoken word \nrecording. \"Jerome Robbins' Broadway\" was named best musical cast show album. \nPeter Asher was voted pop producer of the year. \n\n\nIn the composition categories, Carly Simon's \"Let the River Run,\" from the film \n\"Working Girl,\" was named best song written for a movie, while Danny Elfman's \n\"Batman\" theme was voted best instrumental composition. \n\n\nThe classical Grammys produced a bumper crop of surprises this year. \n\n\nBest album -- a category dominated by big-budget, big-name symphonies and \noperas -- went to the Emerson Quartet's Bartok set, which also took the chamber \nmusic award. Placido Domingo and Kathleen Battle lost the vocal soloist prize \nto Dawn Upshaw and her Barber-Menotti-Harbison-Stravinsky program with the \nOrchestra of St. Luke's. \n\n\nMemorial sentiment did not help Herbert von Karajan's final recording, nor did \n25 weeks on the best-seller charts boost Gerard Schwarz and the Seattle \nSymphony past Leonard Bernstein's Mahler Third in the orchestral category. \n\n\nOther areas proved more predictable. Bloc voting from the Atlanta classical \ncontingent no doubt contributed to the choral performance and engineering \nawards for Robert Shaw's recording of Britten's \"War Requiem.\" Steve Reich -- \nthe only American composer on the ballot -- took the composition prize for \n\"Different Trains.\" \n\n\nThe award for best opera went to the Metropolitan Opera's recording of Wagner's \n\"Die Walkure.\" \n\n\nTimes staff writer John Henken contributed to this story."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0133", "docId": "179853", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Part A; Page 1; Column 1; Metro Desk", "length": "1808", "headline": "COLUMN ONE;", "byline": "By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, Czech defector Josef Kubicek, left, talks with Redondo Beach City \nCouncilman Terry Ward. HARRY CHASE / Los Angeles Times", "text": "The idea struck Redondo Beach Councilman Terry Ward last month like a peal from \nthe Liberty Bell: A constituent, a Czechoslovakian immigrant, had asked if the \nbeachside city might be interested in becoming a sister city of Prague, the \ncapital of his homeland. \n\n\n\"I thought, 'My God, what a terrific idea!' \" Ward said, recalling his pleasure \nat the thought of casting a local vote of confidence in the recent democratic \nreforms in Eastern Europe. \n\n\n\"It touched me deeply. I wanted to move as fast as I could because I was afraid \nsome other city would get the idea, too.\" \n\n\nToo late. \n\n\nEven as Ward was firing off an invitation to the mayor of Prague -- a letter \nstudded with congratulations to him, his city and the whole nation of \nCzechoslovakia -- Chicago was issuing a rival proposition to Prague to become \nits partner in a cultural exchange. \n\n\nStirred by the developments that have swept the communist world in recent \nmonths, U.S. municipalities nationwide are vying to establish city-level \ndiplomatic ties with the fledgling local governments of Eastern Europe, \naccording to the Alexandria, Va.,-based Sister Cities International, which acts \nas a clearinghouse for the municipal affiliations. \n\n\n\"We're getting inquiries about Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, East Germany,\" \nsaid Tom Gittins, Sister Cities International executive vice president. \n\n\n\"Muscatine, Iowa, and Cedar Rapids want to develop Czechoslovakian \nrelationships, and Bloomington, Ind., has indicated they want a relationship \nwith an East German city. Chicago has a serious proposal out for Prague and \nCleveland is interested in Bratislava. The mayor of Fort Worth (Tex.) just got \nback from Budapest, and Toledo, Ohio, and New Brunswick, N.J., are working on \nHungarian cities.\" \n\n\nThe heightened interest is the understandable byproduct of a year of \nextraordinary change worldwide, Gittins and others say. To many, a link with \nthe communist world right now is a link with history, observers say. And in the \nlight of reform, governments that once seemed impenetrable now feel more \napproachable to Americans. \n\n\nNext month, he said, a team of Polish emissaries will visit 10 U.S. cities to \nlearn the rudiments of running a local government. Meanwhile, demand is \nskyrocketing for affiliations with Soviet cities in the age of perestroika. \nOnly last month, for example, Los Angeles officially adopted Leningrad, and \nPasadena decided to pursue a link with Byurakan, a research center in Soviet \nArmenia that once was closed to foreigners. \n\n\n\"Three years ago, there were only six sister cities in the Soviet Union. Today \nthere are 52, and we have about 60 pending inquiries,\" Gittins said. \"As you \ncan well imagine, there's a lot of excitement and a lot of change.\" \n\n\nSet up to promote cultural understanding through student exchanges and the \nlike, sister cityhood, although generally apolitical in theory, has over the \nyears shifted with changing global politics. When President Richard M. Nixon \nvisited China, for example, U.S. towns rushed to find partners in that country, \nsaid Dick Oakland, director of member services for Sister Cities International. \nNow, in the wake of last June's massacre at Tien An Men Square, China is out, \nhe said. \n\n\nAfter Nixon's visit to China in the early 1970s, 40 U.S. cities established \nties with municipalities there. But in the wake of the Beijing bloodshed, no \nnew links have been forged, and 18 to 20 affiliations that were being \nnegotiated have been put on hold. \n\n\nIn 1979, during the American hostage crisis, Los Angeles unilaterally suspended \nits sister city relationship with Tehran, and did not even bother to inform its \nsister city's government. \n\n\n\"It's a matter of what's hot and what's not,\" Oakland said. \"And, right now, \nEastern Europe is very hot.\" \n\n\nAn offshoot of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's mid-1950s \"People-to-People\" \ninitiative, Sister Cities International has linked about 870 U.S. cities with \nabout 1,400 sister cities in 91 countries, Gittins said. Los Angeles has 16, \nmore than any other city in the United States. \n\n\nThe relationships typically involve official visits, pen pal programs, zoo \nexchanges and other symbolic gestures of friendship that give even the most \nisolated U.S. towns a window on the world. In return, foreign cities -- which, \nunlike U.S. cities, can have only one sister city at a time -- get the \nadvantage of direct medical, cultural and trade exchanges. \n\n\nA handful of those partnerships are in communist Europe -- Chicago, for \nexample, has been a sister city of Warsaw since the 1960s. But most of those \nrelationships, including the Chicago-Warsaw link, have been dormant until now, \nofficials say, partly because the communist governments were uninterested or \nwary, and partly because of U.S. opposition to human rights violations in the \nSoviet bloc. \n\n\nAs recently as 1984, for example, the politically conservative City Council of \nVista, citing national security, turned down a local grandmother's emotional \nappeal to take a Soviet community as a sister city. The woman ended up creating \na U.S.-Soviet pen pal program in her San Diego County city under the auspices \nof a now-defunct pacifist group based in Portland, Ore. \n\n\nIn 1985, then-San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein was forced to take back her \ncity's invitation to Leningrad because of criticism from fellow Democrats and \nher city's Jewish community. And in 1987, opposition from an anti-Soviet group \nkilled a proposal in Costa Mesa to make its first sister city the Soviet \ncommunity of Melitopol. \n\n\nBut in the wake of reforms, such relationships are now being sought by even the \nmost conservative cities, said Steven Kalishman of the Center for Innovative \nDiplomacy, based in Washington, D.C., with offices in Irvine. \n\n\n\"The people who were interested before (in Soviet bloc sister cities) felt they \nneeded to do something because of the nuclear situation,\" Kalishman said. \n\n\n\"Now, people are interested for different reasons -- they want to be able to \ntell their kids and grandkids that they were part of the revolution. \n\n\n\"Also, with Eastern Europe opening up, there is a lot of money to be be made,\" \nKalishman said. \"Through the sister city organizations, a lot of smaller \ncorporations will have the opportunity for trade.\" \n\n\nLocal officials, however, say that most recent efforts to link with Eastern \nEurope are based more on emotion than economics. The majority, they say, have \nbeen initiated by Eastern Bloc dissidents who emigrated here, and who are \nhoping to re-establish contact with their homelands after being estranged for \nyears. \n\n\nIn Fort Worth, for example, the push to join with Budapest came at the behest \nof a pair of Hungarian-born Texas businessmen, said Toni Brown, executive \ndirector of the Fort Worth sister cities program. \n\n\nOne of the men was an old friend of the mayor of Budapest, who -- in the age of \nHungarian political reform -- was anxious for an alliance with a U.S. city, \nBrown said. The businessman approached Fort Worth City Hall, got the go-ahead \nto pursue the idea, and in early December a Hungarian delegation arrived in \nFort Worth. \n\n\n\"We took them to a ranch and a rodeo,\" Brown said, \"and visited some schools \nand companies. We met with the Chamber of Commerce, did some Rotary (clubs), \nhad a lot of private dinners and receptions.\" \n\n\nAt the end of the visit, the delegation from Budapest publicly invited Fort \nWorth to be its sister city. But \"the real shockeroo,\" according to Brown, came \nat a private dinner held just after the announcement when the notoriously \nreclusive pianist Van Cliburn, who lives in Fort Worth, disclosed that he \nwanted to celebrate the new relationship by playing a rare concert this summer \nin Budapest. \n\n\nBrown said the union will become official with a signing ceremony the Fort \nWorth City Council hopes to link to the Van Cliburn concert several months from \nnow. Meanwhile, in the spirit of the union, a delegation of Hungarian \njournalists has scheduled a trip to Fort Worth to bone up on U.S. political \njournalism. \n\n\n\"Hungary's going to have their first election ever and the reporters there \ndon't know how to cover one,\" Brown explained. \n\n\nIn Redondo Beach, which has no Czech community to speak of and which already \nhas two sister cities in Mexico, a similar personal contact prompted Ward's \ninvitation to Prague. \n\n\nJosef Kubicek, a local developer who had defected from Czechoslovakia in 1964, \nsaid the idea came to him after reforms brought his old friends from the Czech \nresistance into power. Forty-one years of communist rule ended on Dec. 10, when \nCzech President Gustav Husak resigned, swearing in a new 21-member cabinet with \nthe Communist Party in a minority role. \n\n\n\"When the revolution actually happened, I knew that people in Prague needed \nemotional help more than anything else,\" said Kubicek, 55. He thought of \napproaching the Los Angeles City Council, since Los Angeles is better known, he \nsaid, but his City Hall contacts were all in Redondo Beach, where he has done \nbusiness for more than 20 years. \n\n\nSo he took his idea to Ward, hoping, he said, that it would \"let the people of \nCzechoslovakia know that people on the other side were thinking about them.\" \n\n\nThere were a few glitches: Ward speaks nary a word of Czech, and when he asked \na friend to help him find the name of the mayor of Prague, they came up with \nthe wrong mayor -- a Communist who had just been ousted. \n\n\nBy the time the letter was delivered to Prague, the old Communist mayor had \nbeen replaced. \n\n\nKubicek said he ended by hand-delivering Ward's letter late last month to the \nnew mayor, Jaroslav Koran, who opened it on the day of his inauguration and \ndidn't seem to mind that it was addressed to his Communist predecessor. \n\n\nKubicek said Koran was \"deeply moved,\" although \"I don't think he ever heard of \nRedondo Beach.\" \n\n\nKoran sent back a letter expressing \"great interest\" in the offer and \nauthorizing Redondo Beach to make a formal application to Sister Cities \nInternational. On Tuesday, Ward got a local go-ahead from the Redondo Beach \nCity Council. \n\n\nWhat will become of the offer is unclear. Lois Weisberg, Chicago's commissioner \nof cultural affairs, said Chicago has not yet had formal contact with Prague \nbut has already asked Sister Cities International for priority on the Czech \ncapital. \n\n\nWho will get Prague will be up to the international group, but Weisberg said \nChicago is particularly anxious. \n\n\nInitially, she said, her city had put in for Budapest, only to find that Fort \nWorth had gotten there first. \n\n\nMeanwhile, in Redondo Beach, Ward said he will fly to Washington next week to \nlobby the Czechoslovakian Consulate. \n\n\n\"If we don't get Prague, I don't know what we'll do. Suck our thumbs and pout, \nI guess,\" Ward said. \"It doesn't mean we wouldn't be interested in reaching out \nto another (Eastern European) city though. We've got to teach these people what \ndemocracy's all about.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0134", "docId": "179854", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Part A; Page 1; Column 3; National Desk", "length": "863", "headline": "PRICE RISE OF 1.1% HIGHEST IN EIGHT YEARS", "byline": "By OSWALD JOHNSTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": "Chart, A Worrisome Trend -- Monthly percentage change in the overall consumer \nprice index and the core inflation rate -- the CPI excluding food and energy. \nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics. Los Angeles Times", "text": "Consumer prices shot up 1.1% in January, the largest monthly increase in nearly \neight years, the Labor Department reported Wednesday, prompting warnings from \neconomists that Americans may be facing a new inflationary spiral. \n\n\nFueling the January price gain was December's record cold snap, which caused \nhuge jumps in energy and food costs. But even without energy and food, the core \ninflation rate for January was a troublesome 0.6%. \n\n\nIf maintained for a full year, that would translate to an annual inflation rate \nof nearly 7.5%, contrasted with last year's 4.5%. \n\n\nEconomists said the Federal Reserve Board, which nudged interest rates down as \nthe economy showed signs of cooling in 1989, is unlikely to allow rates to fall \nfurther as long as inflation appears to be gaining momentum. \n\n\n\"Most of the energy and food (price gains) will probably unwind in the next few \nmonths, but it will be hard to get the core rate below where it is,\" said Bruce \nSteinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch in New York. \n\n\n\"Inflation is certainly not declining, because labor costs were rising at about \n5% last year -- which puts a floor under what inflation reduction can do,\" \nSteinberg said. \"There's not much comfort here.\" \n\n\nWith energy and food costs included, January's gain was the biggest monthly \njump in the Consumer Price Index since the 1.1% increase posted in June, 1982, \nwhen the economy was still recovering from the inflationary binge of the 1970s. \n\n\nThe White House, which tends to interpret economic statistics as favorably as \npossible, acknowledged that January's retail figures were too high for comfort. \n\n\n\"This is disappointing news,\" White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater \nsaid. \"We are hopeful that this is a bulge that will be temporary in nature, \nbut inflation requires eternal vigilance, and we remain on a policy of wanting \nsteady growth with low inflation.\" \n\n\nOn Tuesday, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that \nlingering inflationary pressures remain a stubborn problem for the U.S. \neconomy. He suggested that the Fed would not allow interest rates to decline \nfrom current levels. \n\n\nThe price figures, along with the prospect that the Federal Reserve Board will \nkeep a tight grip on the nation's credit supply, offered little in the way of \nencouragement to consumers or investors. \n\n\nInterest rate jitters have contributed to recent declines in the stock and bond \nmarkets, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling nearly 39 points Tuesday \nand another 13 points Wednesday. \n\n\nIn his testimony, Greenspan said economic indicators suggest that the economy \nis increasing in strength. \"While we cannot be certain that we are as yet out \nof the recessionary woods, such evidence warrants at least guarded optimism,\" \nhe said. \n\n\nGreenspan said the Fed had lowered its overall inflation estimate for 1990 to \n4% to 4.5%, down from a June forecast of 4.5% to 5%. The Bush Administration, \nmeanwhile, is forecasting a 4.1% inflation rate. \n\n\nBut January's retail price report could raise doubts about both projections and \nthe Fed's ability to keep inflation in check. \n\n\n\"This report is disturbingly high, because if you take out special factors it \nstill leaves inflation at a 7.5% annual rate -- which is much higher than the \nFed target,\" said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co. in New York. \n\n\n\"The key here is services inflation,\" Sinai said. \"That sector is strong, in \nshort supply of workers, and wage costs are going up. Commodity prices can \ngyrate like a yo-yo, but services inflation is rock-hard.\" \n\n\nThe nation's growing services sector, which accounts for nearly 55% of the CPI, \nposted a 0.6% price gain. \n\n\nBut it was record cold weather that was responsible for much of January's price \ngain. Home heating oil soared a record 26.3%, pacing a 5.1% increase for \noverall energy prices. Fruit and vegetable prices jumped a record 10.2%, \npushing the overall food index up 1.8% for the month. \n\n\nAlthough the Labor Department noted that food and energy accounted for 60% of \nthe overall January price increases, economists warned that the report \ncontained ominous signs of pervasive inflation in virtually every category of \nthe CPI. \n\n\nAuto prices, for example, rose 0.6% during the month after sizable 0.8% and \n1.1% increases in December and November, when new-year models came out. Medical \nservices, which tend to outrun other categories, were up 0.6% in January. \n\n\n\"This is not a good report,\" said Stacy Kottman of the economic forecasting \nunit at Georgia State University in Atlanta. \"The most optimistic we can be is \nthat, by the second quarter, we should see relief in food and energy. But these \nare real price moves which drain disposable income from people's pockets. It \nhas a dampening economic impact.\" \n\n\nIn Greater Los Angeles, consumer prices rose 1.1% for the month before seasonal \nadjustment, compared to a 1% unadjusted increase nationwide. \n\n\nBefore adjusting for seasonal changes, the consumer price index stood at 127.4 \nin January. That means a hypothetical cross section of goods and services that \ncost $100 in the 1982-84 base period would have cost $127.40 last month, up \nfrom $126.10 in December and $121.10 a year earlier."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0135", "docId": "179861", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Part A; Page 3; Column 1; Metro Desk", "length": "820", "headline": "STORMS FAIL TO CUT DROUGHT;", "byline": "By MARK A.

Many are facing the difficult \nchoice of finding alternative water supplies -- by pumping more from the ground \nor buying from neighbors -- or scaling back operations and scrambling to find a \nway to make loan payments. \n\n\nThe outlook for an end to the drought is not good, state water officials said \nWednesday. No more storms are due in February, the last of the season's three \nwettest months, and forecasters do not expect a repeat of 1989's March Miracle, \nin which unseasonable storms delayed serious shortages. \n\n\n\"It would take several pretty heavy storms to bring us out of it,\" said Gino \nYoung of the California Department of Water Resources Drought Center in \nSacramento. \"Normal rainfall for the rest of the year is not going to do it at \nthis point.\" \n\n\nDespite pounding storms that have inundated some Sierra towns with snow and \nwashed down coastal cities, the state has seen only 70% of usual precipitation \nthis year, Young said. Most of that has already soaked into dry soils, leaving \nlittle to run off into reservoirs or percolate into ground-water basins. \n\n\nAs of Tuesday, for example, the state's Four River Index measured only 4.26 \nmillion acre-feet flowing in the Sacramento, Feather, Yuba and American rivers \nsystems, the main source of the state's surface water. Water from those rivers \nslakes the thirst of Central Valley farms and cities in Northern and Southern \nCalifornia. \n\n\nAt the current pace, those rivers will probably move about 11 million acre-feet \nof water in the entire year, Young said, or about 60% of normal. Based on \nhistorical rainfall patterns, there is only a 10% chance that enough rain will \nfall in the rest of the year to move the index into the normal range. \n\n\nRunoff is unlikely to increase in the spring because the state's snowpack \ncontains 62% of the water it historically should contain this late in the rainy \nseason. This is up from only 45% of normal two weeks ago. \n\n\nA lack of new water is compounded by low reservoir levels caused by three \nearlier drought years. As of Wednesday, statewide reservoir capacity stood at \n68% of its historic average for that date. In real terms, the state's biggest \nstorage sites were less than half full. \n\n\nIn scattered cases, the situation is much worse. Lake Isabella northeast of \nBakersfield, for example, still contains only about 15% of capacity, according \nto state water-monitoring computers. \n\n\nState water officials have been trying to increase precipitation by seeding \nclouds, but the program has come under attack in rural Sierra County northwest \nof Lake Tahoe. Residents and elected officials there complain that additional \nsnowfall will cause them hardship and cost them more for everything from space \nheating to snow plowing to flood control in the spring. \n\n\nWilliam I. DuBois of the California Farm Bureau Federation said growers are \nalready making hard choices about what to do if they cannot work out a way to \nreplace the water being withheld by the Central Valley Project. \n\n\nSome growers, he said, will simply match the 50% water cut by planting 50% \nfewer acres, usually forsaking surplus crops, such as grains, in favor of \nperishable annuals, such as vegetables. \n\n\nLivestock operators will line up outside sources of feed for their cattle, \nsheep and other animals. This feed, from such places as the Colorado River \nbasin that are not experiencing cutbacks, will pressure prices upward. \n\n\nFruit and nut growers with trees in the ground likely will simply try to keep \ntheir orchards alive through the summer using whatever water is available and \nnot worrying about poor crop yields. \n\n\n\"It is serious, no doubt about that,\" DuBois said. \"But it's not equally \nserious for all growers. . . . These people are really ingenious. Most of them \nwill figure out a way to get by with the least possible damage.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0136", "docId": "179862", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Part A; Page 3; Column 4; Metro Desk", "length": "1637", "headline": "TEENS WERE TOLD OF THIN ICE, CAMP SAYS;", "byline": "By JOEL SAPPELL and CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, COLOR, Diving team member at lake. ; Photo, Washoe County, Nev., divers \nDon Matteoni, left, and Jim Davis work in icy waters looking for victims near \nConvict Lake shoreline.

THOMAS \nKELSEY / Los Angeles Times", "text": "As rescue divers lifted five more bodies from the frigid depths of this Sierra \nlake Wednesday, officials at the residential camp attended by the lake's \nteen-age victims said the youths were warned shortly before their deaths that \nthe ice on which they were playing was too thin. \n\n\n\"Come back! It's too dangerous!\" camp counselor Randy Porter yelled at three \nteen-agers who were venturing toward the center of the lake, witnesses said. \n\n\nAnother boy also cried out to the group, according to a chronology prepared by \nofficials at Camp O'Neal, where three victims resided and two others worked as \ncounselors. \n\n\n\"This is dangerous. We should go back. We could kill ourselves,\" the statement \nquoted the youngster as telling his friends. \n\n\n\"He also stated that the ice was cracking under their feet as he made these \ncomments,\" the statement said. \"They (the victims) kept walking.\" \n\n\nMoments after the warnings, the three youngsters dropped through the ice, \nsetting off a chain-reaction that ended with them and four would-be rescuers \ndead in the freezing lake waters. Porter, who issued the first warning, died as \nhe struggled to rescue the children. Camp officials said it was his first day \nat work. \n\n\nThe camp's statement was approved for release by the Mono County Sheriff's \nDepartment, which is leading the investigation into the deaths. It came as \nsheriff's deputies announced their own preliminary findings, which confirmed \nthat adult counselors were with the youngsters on the ice shortly before their \nhiking party turned disastrous at noon Monday. \n\n\nThe level of supervision accorded the youngsters has been a central part of the \ninvestigation into the deaths. \n\n\nThe findings of the investigators -- who include officers from the Sheriff's \nDepartment and the U.S. Forest Service -- will be forwarded to the Mono County \ndistrict attorney on Friday, Sheriff-Coroner Martin Strelneck said. He refused \nto comment on whether the teen-agers should have been allowed on the ice. \n\n\n\"I don't think I want to comment on that because of the continuing \ninvestigation,\" he said. \n\n\nMeanwhile, rescue teams using a sophisticated underwater camera worked \nthroughout the day Wednesday and spotted all six bodies that remained trapped \nin the lake. One victim had been recovered Tuesday. \n\n\nOn Wednesday morning, members of the Los Angeles County sheriff's diving team \npulled up two bodies that had been resting on the sandy bottom 117 feet below \nthe lake's surface. Authorities identified them as two 15-year-olds, David C. \nSellers of Tulare and Shawn Rayne Diaz of Dinuba. \n\n\nAnother two were brought to the surface Wednesday afternoon. They were \nidentified as volunteer firefighter Vidar Anderson, 58, of nearby Sunnyslope, \nand counselor Porter, 36. \n\n\nA fifth body was pulled out shortly before dark. The Mono County Sheriff's \nDepartment said the victim was a juvenile. They would not officially identify \nhim, but the third teen-ager who fell into the water Monday was Ryan \nMcCandless, 13, of Redlands, whose parents said he had just arrived at Camp \nO'Neal on Friday. \n\n\nDeputies said the sixth body had been sighted, but waters clouded over before \nthe diving team could move in. That final body was presumed to be that of camp \ncounselor Dave Meyers, 53, of Bishop. Tim Christensen, who runs a school on the \ncamp's grounds, described Meyers as an experienced back-country hiker who was \nfamiliar with conditions on the lake. \n\n\nThe recovery effort was halted as darkness fell and will resume at daylight \ntoday. \n\n\nSheriff's deputies, who earlier had predicted that they would not find all the \nbodies, credited the underwater camera for their success Wednesday. Its \noriginator, Mark St. James of Reno, volunteered the camera and his services. \nThe cylindrical camera can broadcast pictures from any depth to rescuers on the \nsurface and can stay submerged in the icy water for long periods. \n\n\nLos Angeles Sheriff's Capt. Steve Batchelor, who supervised the diving team, \ncalled St. James \"today's hero.\" \n\n\n\"I'm sure we would not have recovered all these bodies without him,\" he said. \n\n\nThe victim recovered Tuesday was U.S. Forest Service employee Clay Cutter, 31, \nwho ran to the lake to rescue others and was himself trapped. Cutter's wife, \nTerry, held a tearful lakeside press conference Wednesday in which she \nrecounted watching her husband struggling to save others before he went through \nthe ice. \n\n\n\"I knew that Clay would not have had it another way,\" she said, her voice \nbreaking. \n\n\n\"God needed him early because he's such a good man.\" \n\n\nThe chronologies released by the Mono County sheriff-coroner and the camp \nWednesday addressed a major question for the investigators, who have, among \nother things, been trying to determine whether the children were unsupervised \nor whether counselors were with them on the treacherous ice. \n\n\nAccording to what investigators have been able to piece together so far, 16 \nteen-agers and two adults left the camp on a recreational outing Monday morning \nand ended up playing on the ice at Convict Lake. It was not immediately clear \nhow deep the water was in the area where they initially played. \n\n\nAt some point, they broke into three separate groups, two of them accompanied \nby a counselor. The group without the counselor, Strelneck said, ventured \nfarther out onto the lake than the others and was playing there when the ice \nbeneath them shattered. Four of the five fell through, including the three who \ndrowned and a fourth who made it back to shore. The unidentified teen-ager was \nhospitalized briefly. \n\n\nSeeing the ice crack, the counselors rushed to help the boys and fell through \nin what was a shallower, though no less lethal, area. They and two rescue \nworkers who arrived later all perished. \n\n\n\"(Counselor) Dave Meyers dropped his gear and went running in to save the \nboys,\" the camp's report said. \"Randy (Porter) immediately told the kids to \ncall 911 and then went in after the kids.\" \n\n\nMeyers, the camp statement said, was able to lift one of the boys from the \nwater. \n\n\n\"(Meyers) went back in to the water to help the others,\" the report said. \"It \nis unclear if the child he got out fell back in or jumped in to help others.\" \n\n\nAuthorities identified Sellers as the boy Meyers had pulled out of the water. \n\n\nThe camp, meanwhile, sought to counter any questions about the conduct of its \nemployees. In addition to releasing the report, which repeatedly noted that the \nteen-agers had been warned off the ice, it also flew to Convict Lake the \nparents of one victim, Ryan McCandless. Speaking before their son's body was \nrecovered, Ryan's father, Kerry McCandless, said he held the camp blameless. \n\n\n\"The kids made a choice to go out on the lake,\" McCandless said. \"It was wrong. \n. . . Accidents do happen.\" \n\n\nMcCandless and his wife, Linda, spent the afternoon at the camp, where they \ntalked to residents and were consoled by counselors. While they were there, \ngroups of boys slept or lounged in a dayroom, receiving updates as the bodies \nwere identified. \n\n\nSheriff-Coroner Strelneck, in comments to reporters Wednesday, characterized \nthe investigation as a \"borderline case\" and said his plans to forward it to \nthe district attorney did not imply that criminal charges would be filed. \nStrelneck said he decided to forward it to Dist. Atty. Stan Eller to ensure a \nthorough review. \n\n\nU.S. Forest Service spokesman Dave Reider said the agency is reviewing its \ninvolvement in the tragedy, and said the probe could lead to a change in its \npolicy of not posting signs warning of thin ice. But he said it would be \nimpossible to police all of the state's lakes well enough to keep people off \nthe ice. The Forest Service has jurisdiction over Convict Lake. \n\n\n\"There are hundreds of lakes and we can't post them all,\" he said. Even so, \nReider issued a warning: \"California's wild lands are inherently dangerous.\" \n\n\nOn the icy lake surface, some rescuers spent the morning probing the hole into \nwhich the teen-agers disappeared, which is closer to the center than the one \ninto which the adults fell. \n\n\nOn Tuesday, a diving team from Washoe, Nev., was probing in the shallower area \nwhere the adults were last seen and came upon Cutter's body when they pulled on \na rope that was floating below the ice. Cutter's hand was still grasping the \nend of the rope, which he had taken with him when he raced from his home toward \nthe lake. \n\n\nBut no other bodies were sighted, and authorities on Wednesday moved toward the \ndeeper area where the children were last seen, using an air-propelled boat and \nthe underwater camera. The camera spotted, in rapid succession, the remaining \nbodies. \n\n\nEfforts to retrieve the bodies were delayed for hours by a broken starter on \nthe rescue boat. When the effort resumed, members of the Los Angeles diving \nteam slipped into the lake, replacing the Washoe County team. Unlike the Nevada \nteam, whose equipment limits it to dives of about 80 feet, the Los Angeles team \ncan dive to about 300 feet, officials said. The Los Angeles team also has \ntwo-way radio equipment that allows it to communicate with supervisors at the \nsurface. \n\n\nSeven divers from Los Angeles arrived at the lake early Wednesday. \n\n\n\"I'm sorry we can't be here saving lives,\" said sheriff's Capt. Batchelor, a \ndive team supervisor. \n\n\nThroughout the day, onlookers watched the rescue effort from the shoreline, \namong them the families of the victims. \n\n\nShannon Collins, the step-granddaughter of Vidar Anderson, the volunteer \nfirefighter who lost his life trying to save other victims, came to the lake \nWednesday against the wishes of her family. They felt it would be too \ntraumatic, but she said she had to be there. \n\n\n\"Somebody had to be here for him,\" she said. \"I'm here because I loved him.\" \n\n\nSappell reported from Convict Lake and Decker from Los Angeles.

LACY ATKINS / Los Angeles Times", "text": "In a surprise victory for a part-Aleut mother, a Santa Ana judge reversed \nhimself Wednesday and decided that the teen-ager's native Indian tribe has no \nright to dictate who will adopt her 8-month-old baby. \n\n\nThe ruling by Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert J. Polis gave Jodi \nArgleben, 19, of Cypress, the right to choose who will rear her daughter, \nRebecca. Argleben already has selected a couple in Vancouver, Canada, and \nsmuggled the baby into their care in September. The baby has remained there \nduring the protracted legal struggle over the adoption here and in Canada. \n\n\nA final decision almost certainly will be delayed by appeals. But Argleben has \nsworn that she will rear Rebecca herself rather than surrender her to the \nAleuts in Akhiok, the small village on Kodiak Island, Alaska, where the \nteen-ager was born. \n\n\nArgleben beamed as Polis announced his decision Wednesday. Later, she said \nsimply: \"It's great.\" \n\n\nJack Trope, the attorney representing the Aleut tribe, said he was so shocked \nby Polis' decision that he had not yet considered an appeal. But Argleben's \nattorney, Christian R. Van Deusen, said he expects the Aleuts to appeal. \n\n\nPolis ruled Jan. 19 that the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act gave the tribe the \nright to make sure Rebecca is placed with an Aleut family. The Aleuts had cited \nthat law, designed to stem the breakup of Indian families and the loss of their \ncustoms and culture. \n\n\nPolis said at the time that he made the decision reluctantly, because he felt \nthat the law infringed on a woman's right to reproductive freedom by \"reaching \ninto her womb\" and dictating who will rear her baby if she decides to give it \nup for adoption. But he said his personal objections did not make the law \nunconstitutional, so he had to follow it. \n\n\nFaced with Argleben's request for reconsideration Wednesday, Polis initially \nindicated that he was inclined to stick by his decision. But one hour later, he \nchanged his mind. \n\n\nPolis zeroed in on a section of the law that says that Indian nations must be \nnotified when an Indian child is being taken from its parents against the \nparents' will. But he noted that the law requires no such notice when an Indian \nchild is voluntarily surrendered for adoption. \n\n\nThe judge reasoned that if Congress did not mandate notice to the Indians in \nvoluntary adoptions, it \"may well be that (Indian tribes) have no right to be \nheard\" in those situations. \n\n\nHe said there is no question that Indian nations have been subjected to \"crass \nracism and discrimination\" by whites who felt that troubled life on tribal \nreservations entitled them to \"drag off\" Indian children and have them adopted \nby non-Indian families. \n\n\nBut the circumstances of Rebecca's adoption are not the ones contemplated by \nCongress when it passed the Indian Child Welfare Act, Polis said. Rebecca has \nvirtually no link to Aleut culture, since Jodi Argleben is only half Aleut and \nwas adopted by a white family when she was 18 months old. \n\n\nIf the baby were being taken from her parents and an existing Indian community \ninvoluntarily, Polis said, his decision \"would be quite different.\" \n\n\nHe also told Trope, the lawyer for the Aleuts, that he was troubled by the fact \nthat Rebecca's Indian heritage means her mother loses control over her \nadoption."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0138", "docId": "179864", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Part A; Page 3; Column 4; Metro Desk", "length": "473", "headline": "LOTTO JACKPOT REACHES RECORD $67 MILLION", "byline": "From Associated Press", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, (Southland Edition) Line forms at Puente Hills Mall as the hopeful wait \nto buy tickets in the $60-million-plus lottery.

On Monday, an \nassociation of West Germans forced to leave Silesia at the end of the war \npledged to continue pressing their claims on the territory. \n\n\n\"We cannot give up our homeland,\" said Herbert Czaja, head of the group and a \ndeputy in the federal Parliament in the Christian Democratic party of \nChancellor Helmut Kohl. \n\n\nUnder the pressure of conservatives in his election campaign, Kohl has not \nclearly stated his recognition of the Polish borders. \n\n\nAdam Michnik, a Solidarity Parliament deputy, criticized Kohl in Paris on \nTuesday for his failure to do so. \"If Mr. Kohl wants to be credible with his \nneighbors, he should express himself openly.\" \n\n\nEast and West Germany have individually signed agreements recognizing Poland's \nwestern border, but Mazowiecki said Wednesday that he felt the agreements are \nunsatisfactory in the changing situation. \n\n\n\"We cannot have a situation in which we are told that a treaty is no longer \nbinding because one of the countries involved no longer exists,\" he said. \n\n\n\"We have passed in the alliance with the Soviet Union to the state level from \nthe ideological level,\" Mazowiecki said. \"But this does not mean that . . . we \ndo not see the importance of this alliance for the security of our borders.\" \n\n\nAlthough Polish public opinion supports a withdrawal of Soviet troops, \nMazowiecki said, \"We assess this situation realistically, in the perspective of \nthe Germany problem, and thus at this moment do not put the issue in such a \ncategory.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0140", "docId": "179872", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Part A; Page 6; Column 1; Foreign Desk", "length": "867", "headline": "GORBACHEV POWER PLAN FUELS DEBATE;", "byline": "By MASHA HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "Debate is growing in the Soviet Union over President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's \nproposals to strengthen the presidency, with some warning that the Kremlin may \nbe creating legal mechanisms that eventually could turn the country into a \ndictatorship. \n\n\nOthers argue that the Soviet Union is being transformed so radically and \nquickly that it threatens to slide into chaos unless the president is given \nbroad new powers to control the changes. \n\n\nNew details emerged this week about the extent of the authority Gorbachev hopes \nto see vested in the presidency, including the power to declare a state of \nemergency in any area even without the approval of regional leaders and the \nright to override legislation passed by parliaments in any of the republics. \n\n\nThe proposed constitutional changes to beef up the role of the presidency have \nbeen presented to deputies on a Supreme Soviet committee that views draft \nlegislation in advance, and the proposals are expected to come soon before the \nentire Congress of People's Deputies, or Parliament, which has the power to \nenact constitutional amendments. \n\n\nGorbachev became chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1988, \nmaking him also the national president. It is his post as general secretary of \nthe Communist Party that gives him his authority, but as the party loses power, \nGorbachev is seeking to dramatically revise that formula. \n\n\nForeign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told Secretary of State James A. Baker \nIII earlier this month that the party leadership decided it was necessary to \nincrease the authority of the office of president if Gorbachev is to be able to \novercome \"obstacles\" slowing perestroika, his program of economic and social \nreform. \n\n\nA number of officials have said that 1990 is a crucial year for the future of \nperestroika but that conservatives are still standing in the way of some \nreforms, particularly of the country's economic system, which they fear would \nrepresent too great an ideological break with communism. \n\n\nIn addition, some officials have complained that Gorbachev does not have enough \nauthority to deal effectively with ethnic unrest that has swept the country at \na dizzying rate. \n\n\nWhen he recently signed an order sending troops to the southern republic of \nAzerbaijan to stop anti-Armenian pogroms and what the Kremlin described as a \nnationalist uprising -- a move many in the nation thought was long overdue -- \nhe had no clear constitutional right to do so. \n\n\nBut some fear that giving the president these vast new powers may be going too \nfar without the proper checks and balances. Their concern about an abuse of \npower is not focused on Gorbachev as much as it is on the leaders who might \nfollow him, the critics say. \n\n\nOthers believe that the Communist Party leadership, which developed its plan \nonly earlier this month as part of an effort to restructure the government, is \ntrying to get it approved by legislators too quickly, without needed debate and \nconsideration. \n\n\n\"I am rather worried by the undue haste with which this is being pushed \nthrough,\" said Anatoly Sobchak, a legislator from Leningrad. \n\n\n\"We need to be sure to create a balance of power,\" Sobchak said in the weekly \nMoscow News, published Wednesday. \"Otherwise, we face the dangerous possibility \nof establishing a dictatorship.\" \n\n\nSergei Alexeyev, chairman of the committee that considers draft laws before \nthey are submitted to the Supreme Soviet as a whole, disagreed. \n\n\nHe said he supports strengthening the presidency as much as possible both to \nhelp Gorbachev in the face of his anti-reform opponents and to lead to greater \npolitical organization in the country. \n\n\nThe new system approved by the Central Committee this month -- under which the \nCommunist Party is no longer to be all-powerful, and could share control of the \ncountry with other parties -- may lead to confusion and even disintegration \ninto nationalist groups unless the president is made the nation's clear leader, \nAlexeyev said. \n\n\n\"It is as though our country were in a region threatened by a landslide, and I \nwould like to get out of this situation as soon as possible,\" Alexeyev told \nMoscow News. \"Delay could lead to the collapse of the state and the country. \n\n\n\"Real power must belong to a strong institution which would stand above all the \npolitical parties and political infighting,\" he said. \n\n\nBut Sergei Stankevich, a member of Alexeyev's committee and prominent liberal \nlegislator, said the planned changes do not provide enough checks and balances \nfor the president's power and predicted the proposals will have a difficult \ntime getting approved unless they are amended. \n\n\n\"The leadership seems to have sent this document out in great haste, apparently \nin an effort to get discussions on it under way,\" Stankevich said in an \ninterview. \"But I definitely cannot support the proposals in their current \nform, and I will actively fight against them.\" \n\n\nUnder the current draft changes, the president initially would be elected by \nthe 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies for a limited term while \npreparations are made for the first direct, nationwide elections of a \npresident. The country's leader would then serve a six-year term, Stankevich \nsaid."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0141", "docId": "179873", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Part A; Page 6; Column 1; Foreign Desk", "length": "783", "headline": "TRADITION WINS AS MOSCOW PUTS CATHEDRAL DESIGN TO VOTE;", "byline": "By DAN FISHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "One design looked like the Taj Mahal.

Gorbachev's perestroika program of reforms. \n\n\nIt is symbolic that one of the two favorite designs submitted for the new \nchurch is an exact image of Christ the Savior Cathedral. Built in the 19th \nCentury to commemorate Russia's defeat of Napoleon, the central Moscow \ncathedral was one of the largest in Europe until the late dictator Josef Stalin \nordered it razed in 1931, to be replaced eventually by a heated, year-round \noutdoor swimming pool. \n\n\nThat was one of at least 40,000 Russian Orthodox churches destroyed here after \nthe 1917 Bolshevik Revolution made atheism the official dogma. Thousands more \nwere confiscated and turned into warehouses. \n\n\nUnder Gorbachev, 1,000 churches have reportedly been given back to the \nPatriarchate, and last fall the leadership permitted the first religious \nservice since 1918 within the Kremlin walls at Uspensky Cathedral, where czars \nwere once crowned and church leaders buried. \n\n\n\"This is the first time (since the revolution) that the Russian Orthodox Church \nhas gotten so much freedom,\" said Valentin V. Solodovnikov, a construction \nengineer formerly employed by the Foreign Ministry to build Soviet embassies \nabroad but now working for the Patriarchate on the cathedral project. \n\n\n\"If you visit any church you'll see crowds. There are many young people. Lots \nof baptisms and weddings. In today's unquiet times, people tend to go to church \nand find peace there,\" added Solodovnikov, himself a professed non-believer. \n\n\n\"The policy today gives ground for a revival of people's interest in the \nchurch,\" agreed Elena Yegorova, who came to look at the competing designs with \nher husband. \"People feel freer.\" \n\n\nSo many came Sunday -- young and old, believers and atheists, men and women -- \nthat the biggest problem was finding paper for them to write down their \nimpressions. Exhibition workers ran out of pre-printed questionnaires by noon, \nwith five more hours of crowds to come. \n\n\nOne teen-age boy had a small silver cross dangling from his pierced left ear. \nMany visitors had learned of the exhibition from a lengthy segment about it on \nthe main television news program Saturday night. \n\n\nIt was first announced in 1988, during the church's millennial celebrations, \nthat a new cathedral would be built, and last year, Moscow Patriarch Pimen \nannounced an open contest to come up with the best design. \n\n\nA wooded hilltop site overlooking the scenic Tsaritsyn Ponds in southeast \nMoscow has already been set aside for the cathedral, and completion is targeted \nfor the year 2000. The church, to be financed entirely from contributions, is \nto hold up to 10,000 people, have underground parking for 700 cars and be \nsurrounded by a park \"with fountains, decorative ponds and exotic plants.\" \n\n\nBy last Dec. 1, about 320 designs had been received from architects and a few \namateurs in more than 50 cities. Many submitted not only drawings but colorful \narchitects' renderings of their designs, and even scale models. Those were the \nmaterials put on public exhibition here. \n\n\nMost -- but not all -- featured at least a few traditional Russian Orthodox \ncupolas, or \"onion domes,\" and one proposal had 45. But beyond that, the \narchitects clearly let their minds roam.

SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "In a victory for workers and consumers, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that \nthe White House may not block regulations intended to warn employees about the \ndangers of hazardous chemicals in their workplace. \n\n\nBoth sides in the dispute predicted that the ruling will have wide \nramifications. Public interest lawyers said it could lead to more public \ndisclosures on everything from food nutrition to the dangers of tampons. \nBusiness officials predicted that the decision would foster more costly and \nunnecessary warning labels. \n\n\nThe high court said that the President's Office of Management and Budget has \nbeen overstepping its bounds by forcing federal agencies to withdraw \nregulations that it found too burdensome for business. \n\n\nThe dispute dates to 1980, when Congress said the OMB could oversee the federal \nbureaucracy to ensure that citizens and businesses were not required to supply \nexcessive and unnecessary paper work to the government. \n\n\nHowever, the court concluded, the Reagan and Bush administrations have used \nthat authority to block the flow of warnings and other information to workers \nand consumers. \n\n\nAlthough the case before the court (Dole vs. United Steelworkers, 88-1434) \nfocused on the disclosures of hazardous chemicals mandated by the Occupational \nSafety and Health Act, the ruling went well beyond that situation. \n\n\n\"We hold that the Paperwork Reduction Act (of 1980) does not give the OMB that \nauthority . . . to review and countermand agency regulations\" that order \nregulated entities, such as manufacturers or employers, to disclose information \nto third parties, such as employees or the public, Justice William J. Brennan \nJr. wrote for a 7-2 majority. \n\n\nChief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. White dissented. \n\n\n\"For the worker, the consumer or the community activist, this will free up the \nflow of information on hazardous materials, consumer warnings and nutrition \nlabeling,\" said David Vladeck, a lawyer with Ralph Nader's Public Citizen \nproject. \n\n\nIn recent years, agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug \nAdministration have not required public disclosures of dangers from chemicals \nand drugs because of OMB pressure, Vladeck said. \n\n\n\"This decision will unshackle those agencies,\" he said. \n\n\nThe United Steelworkers of America and the AFL-CIO first took the OMB to court \nin 1983 for blocking the worker-disclosure rules on hazardous chemicals. Two \nyears ago, an appeals court in Philadelphia ruled for the steelworkers, a \ndecision affirmed by the high court Wednesday. \n\n\n\"We are very pleased with the outcome. This means that all workers will be able \nto continue to have readily available on-the-job site information about toxic \nchemicals and hazards,\" said Margaret Seminario, AFL-CIO's director of safety \nand health. \n\n\nA spokeswoman for the OMB refused to comment on the decision. \n\n\nDuring the Richard M. Nixon Administration, the Bureau of the Budget was \ntransformed into the OMB and given new authority to put the President's stamp \non the vast federal bureaucracy. In the 1980s, the OMB gained even more power \nas former President Ronald Reagan sought to get the government \"off the back\" \nof American business. \n\n\nAll the while, however, the OMB's only legal authority to block federal agency \nregulations was the 1980 anti-paper work law. \n\n\nA series of business organizations joined the Bush Administration, \nunsuccessfully, in urging the high court to grant the OMB broader powers. \n\n\n\"OMB provided a forum for business to make its case. Now that forum has been \neliminated,\" said Clark R. Silcox, who filed a court brief on behalf of the \nBusiness Council on the Reduction of Paperwork. \"There are a dozen other \nregulations out there like this one,\" he said, referring to the hazardous \nchemical disclosure rule upheld Wednesday. \n\n\nHe and other business lawyers contend that zealous federal regulators, if \nunchecked, may require that everyone from pharmacists to gasoline station \nattendants be given lengthy disclosure statements on the dozens of chemicals \nthat could be used in their businesses. \n\n\n\"This means just a lot of extra pieces of paper that are redundant and \nunnecessary,\" said Lawrence W. Bierlein, a lawyer who represented the National \nWholesale Druggists' Assn. \n\n\nIn other rulings, the court: \n\n\n -- Upheld the popular \"rails-to-trails\" program under which abandoned rail \nlines are converted to hiking or biking trails. However, the court said that \nproperty owners whose land is crossed by a trail may file a federal claim for \ncompensation. \n\n\nNationwide, more than 3,000 miles of recreational trails have replaced unused \nrail lines since Congress created the program in 1983. But a Vermont couple \nwhose deed gave them the rights to the abandoned rail line on their land said \nthe program was unconstitutional, both because it violated their property \nrights and because it exceeded Congress' authority. \n\n\nThe high court disagreed unanimously but said the government could be required \nto pay the couple for their property (Presault vs. ICC, 88-1076). \n\n\n -- Said the Social Security Administration may deduct past overpayments of \nbenefits from a recipient's monthly check without granting a hearing. On a 5-4 \nvote, the court overturned a ruling that said this practice was unfair to \nelderly and disabled persons who depend on the money. The court said that the \nlaw required officials to correct errors whenever a recipient has been paid \n\"more or less\" than he or she is entitled to (Sullivan vs. Everhart, 88-1323). \n\n\nTimes labor writer Bob Baker contributed to this story."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0144", "docId": "179882", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Part A; Page 16; Column 3; National Desk", "length": "92", "headline": "BUSH TO VISIT NEW YORK, CALIFORNIA NEXT WEEK", "byline": "By Associated Press", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "President Bush will travel to New York and California next week for a series of \nRepublican political events, the White House said Wednesday. \n\n\nBush will leave Wednesday for a Staten Island fund-raising dinner to benefit \nthe congressional campaign of Republican Susan Molinari.

While no specific allocations of new funds to fight drugs \nin either Los Angeles or Orange counties were discussed, the Orange County \ncontingent said they found the meeting useful. \n\n\n\"We spent 90 minutes addressing in depth the nuts and bolts of the federal \nstrategy of the drug war,\" Vasquez said afterward. \"It provided us with a great \nopportunity to better understand what it is and what it isn't.\" \n\n\nUnder the new anti-drug strategy, Los Angeles and four other targeted areas -- \nHouston, Miami, New York and the U.S.-Mexican border -- qualify to share $25 \nmillion this year in special federal funds to combat the drug problem, and \ntwice that much in 1991. \n\n\nBennett, a graying, tousle-haired administrator nearing the end of his first \nyear as federal drug policy adviser, spent much of Wednesday meeting with \nstate, city and county officials to hear their ideas about anti-drug tactics \nand to brief them on the federal program. \n\n\nBut, playing a favorite role as cheerleader and first-hand observer, he also \ntook time to look at the problems of a particular neighborhood. In choosing the \narea surrounding Jefferson High, the nation's top drug official sought a place \nthat has been hard hit by drugs and related crime -- and a place that is doing \nsomething about it, according to Bennett's aides. \n\n\n\"This is another foray for me into the heart of America,\" Bennett told a crowd \nof several dozen residents from a lectern placed in the middle of 40th Place. \nTraffic was blocked off by police cars while mounted LAPD officers rode past \nhomes like figures out of the Old West. \n\n\nThe street is home to a Latino gang -- Crazy Street Kids -- which reportedly \nhas been feuding with a gang to the south known as the 33rd Street Gang, said \nSang Brown, a block captain of the local Neighborhood Watch program. \n\n\nThere have been eight attempted drive-by shootings reported on 40th Place in \nthe last 18 months, according to Brown. Around the high school, located down \nthe block, there were 37 drive-by shootings and 112 assaults last year, police \nsaid. \n\n\nBennett described 40th Place as a tough neighborhood in a tough region -- \nnoting that 47 gangs inhabit 10 square miles of South-Central Los Angeles. \n\n\n\"And yet progress is being made (here),\" Bennett said. \n\n\nThe LAPD barricade program, nicknamed \"Operation Cul-De-Sac,\" is given much of \nthe credit -- along with community Neighborhood Watch groups -- for \ndiscouraging drug dealing and drive-by attacks. \n\n\nThe six-month program is designed to make it more difficult for dealers and \ngang members to drive through residential areas. In its first two weeks, police \nsaid, the program has contributed to a decrease in crime and, at the same time, \nan increase in daily attendance at 2,590-student Jefferson High. \n\n\n\"One of the most striking things I've ever heard, I heard today,\" Bennett told \nresidents after a closed-door meeting with school Principal Philip Saldivar. \n\"And that's that 150 to 200 more students are back in school\" during the day. \n\n\nSome residents are concerned, however, over what might happen once the program \nends. Asked whether drug dealers and gang shooters will renew their attacks, \nBennett optimistically called for homeowners to take over a part of the burden \nof patrolling their street and reporting crime. \n\n\n\"You never entirely remove the police,\" Bennett said. \"But the responsibility \nmay pass on to other people.\" \n\n\nRather than rely on several policemen, he said, patrols may be taken over by \n\"three or four civilians, with a policeman down the block. That's one way to do \nit.\" \n\n\n\"Drug dealers . . . run from a policeman,\" he added. \"They also run from a \nflashlight. They run from a neighbor with a bullhorn. Someone told me drug \ndealers behave like roaches -- you put the light on them and they run.\" \n\n\nBennett, who was scheduled to continue his West Coast tour with a stop today in \nSan Diego, is mindful of Los Angeles' importance to the anti-drug effort, said \nDavid Robb, a spokesman in Washington. \n\n\nThe region is considered a leading port of entry and trading center for not \nonly cocaine but also PCP and Mexican and Asian heroin, Robb said. A recent \nstudy also disclosed that the average selling price for cocaine is lower in Los \nAngeles than any other place in the nation -- $11,000 to $16,000 a kilogram, he \nsaid."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0150", "docId": "179894", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Part A; Page 26; Column 1; Metro Desk", "length": "387", "headline": "MARROW DONORS DON'T NEED PERFECT MATCH, STUDY FINDS", "byline": "From Staff and Wire Reports", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "Medical researchers unveiled new evidence Wednesday showing that doctors don't \nneed a perfect match when they try to transplant bone marrow into someone whose \nblood-producing cells have been damaged by leukemia or another deadly illness. \n\n\nBone marrow transplants are usually most successful when the marrow is donated \nby a brother or sister whose cells have the same pattern of surface proteins. \nWhen the protein pattern matches, it reduces the likelihood that the donated \nmarrow will be rejected or produce serious side effects. \n\n\nBut researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin, using special techniques \nto cleanse the donated marrow, found that transplants can be successful when \nthe protein pattern in the donor's marrow is similar to, but not identical to, \nthe recipient's. \n\n\nThe findings, reported in the current New England Journal of Medicine, suggest \nthat \"we can now start tapping into the enlarging pool of volunteer marrow \ndonors\" whose marrow \"will lead to satisfactory results for many patients,\" \nsaid Dr. Robert C. Ash, chief author of the study. \n\n\nThe ability to use marrow from unrelated donors is important because only about \n30% of patients who might benefit from a bone marrow transplant will have a \nbrother or sister whose marrow is perfectly matched, Ash said. \n\n\nThis issue was dramatized last week when a 43-year-old Walnut woman disclosed \nthat she was having a baby in the hope that the newborn can become a bone \nmarrow donor for her 17-year-old daughter, who has leukemia. Tests have shown \nthat the fetus's bone marrow is nearly identical. The birth is expected in \nApril. \n\n\nIn the four-year study of 55 patients, the transplants were successful in 48% \nof patientswith early leukemia, 32% of the volunteers whose leukemia had \nreached an advanced stage, and 63% of the patients who suffered from diseases \nother than leukemia. \n\n\n In all, 31 of the 55 patients died, usually from infection. \n\n\nGraft-versus-host disease, a potentially deadly reaction that appears when the \ncells of the transplanted marrow attack the body, occurred in nearly half the \npatients. Ash and his colleagues characterized that rate as relatively low. \n\n\nTo reduce the risk of graftversus-host disease, the donated marrow was \ninitially treatedwith chemicals to kill white blood cells that trigger an \nimmune response."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0151", "docId": "179901", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition", "section": "Metro; Part B; Page 1; Column 2; Metro Desk", "length": "1543", "headline": "O.C. 8TH-GRADERS SCORE WELL ON WRITING TESTS", "byline": "By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": "Table, ORANGE COUNTY GRADE 8 WRITING ASSESSMENT TEST SCORES", "text": "Orange County eighth-graders bucked a slight statewide decline in writing \nscores released Wednesday by posting a six-point increase at the same time that \ntheir counterparts across California dropped a point. \n\n\nOverall, Orange County schools averaged 288 on the test, compared to a \nstatewide average of 255. \n\n\n\"Six points is really quite significant,\" said Tom Fong, a research analyst \nwith the state's California Assessment Program. \"Orange County did very well.\" \n\n\nMost districts in the county showed significant gains, with some leaping by \nmore than 20 points on the 400-point test. Brea-Olinda Unified School District, \nin northern Orange County, scored the greatest improvement, increasing by 22 \npoints to an average of 352. That score put it in the 98th percentile of \ndistricts statewide. \n\n\nAt the district's only junior high school, Principal Mike Condiff credited the \nimprovement to his staff and to a classroom configuration that gives students \ntwo consecutive periods of language arts and lumps the school's highest \nachieving students with others who are struggling. \n\n\n\"Ever since we've gone to that system, our scores have increased dramatically,\" \nhe said. \"If you track kids into a remedial program, all they get is mediocre \nliterature.\" \n\n\nBuena Park Elementary School District, also on the county's northern border, \ndropped by 26 points, the most of any county district. However, its students \nstill posted an average score of 258, three points higher than the state \naverage. Educators there said they were still reviewing the scores. \n\n\nFred Lange, director of the county Education Department's effective schools \nunit, attributed Orange County's generally strong scores to the emphasis area \nschools have placed on writing in recent years. Some districts have also been \nespecially effective at teaching students whose native language is not English, \nhe added. \n\n\n\"We're dealing with many students who come from foreign-language backgrounds, \nand teaching them writing is an important part of their education,\" Lange said. \n\"I think you'll find that our students probably will always be a little bit \nabove the state average.\" Local educators were particularly gratified by the \nprogress made in Santa Ana, which, with 43,000 students, is Orange County's \nlargest district and the ninth biggest in the state. More than half of the \ndistrict's students have limited English skills. Still, writing scores there \nincreased 11 points to 259, for the first time overtaking the state average. \n\n\n\"Santa Ana is to be commended for the tremendous work that they are doing, \nespecially with dealing with their large population of students who have \nlimited English skills,\" Lange said. \n\n\nSanta Ana Supt. Rudy Castruita, an outspoken proponent of improved \nEnglish-as-a-second language instruction, agreed that renewed emphasis on \nwriting skills has helped boost the district's scores. \n\n\nMore than 21,000 Orange County eighth-graders took the 45-minute essay test \nlast spring, and they were among 308,000 students statewide to participate in \nthe exam. Students were required to write an essay in one of eight categories: \nautobiographical incident, evaluation, problem solution, report of information, \nfirsthand biography, story, observational writing or speculation about causes \nor effects. \n\n\nThe essays were graded on the thinking and writing processes they displayed, as \nwell as on basic skills such as spelling and grammar. \n\n\nBecause the exam moves away from multiple-choice testing, it has won high \npraise from some testing experts. Cinthia Schuman, executive director of \nFairTest, a watchdog group campaigning for better ways of measuring student \nachievement, praised California's writing test as \"moving in the right \ndirection.\" \n\n\nStatewide, girls continued to score markedly higher on the writing test than \ndid boys, a pattern that has shown up every year since 1987, when the test was \nfirst administered. This year, girls scored an average of 280, while boys \naveraged 232. \n\n\nThe CAP tests, which are administered annually to almost all California \nstudents at various grade levels, are not meant as barometers of individual \nstudents' performance. Rather, they are used to evaluate schools and the \neffectiveness of their curricula. \n\n\nWhile Orange County educators said their continued success in the writing \nscores was evidence of the county's strong commitment to teaching those skills, \nBill Honig, state superintendent of public instruction, worried that the \nstatewide trend is not as positive. \n\n\nHonig said the one-point dip in scores might be attributable to the addition of \ntwo new writing categories in the eight-essay test but added that \"it's clear \nwe still have a long way to go in developing our students' writing abilities.\" \n\n\nAlthough some teachers and educators complain that CAP scores oversimplify a \nschool's educational performance, Honig said Wednesday that a recent survey \nindicates that the CAP writing test is \"successfully influencing the English \ncurriculum in middle and junior high schools.\" \n\n\nMore than 90% of English teachers polled said they believe that the CAP writing \ntest \"will improve or strengthen\" their schools' English curricula, Honig said. \n\n\nStaff writer Jane Merl in Los Angeles contributed to this report. \n\n\n\n\nORANGE COUNTY GRADE 8 WRITING ASSESSMENT TEST SCORES \n\n\nCalifornia Assessment Program scores for eighth grade writing were released \nWednesday, and Orange County students overall raised their scores by six \npoints. Meanwhile, students across the state dropped one point, at least in \npart because of changes in the test format, according to state officials. The \nOrange County improvement was \"significant,\" state officials said, and local \neducators credited the results to area districts' emphasis on writing skills \nand new programs for educating students who speak English as a second language. \n\n\nTo read the scores: Averages on the 400-point test are listed by county, \ndistrict and individual schools.

The Sheriff's Department did receive $4.6 \nmillion to cover a budget shortfall, but action on the South County patrol \nissue was delayed once again, with the county staff promising to return to the \nboard with its analysis and recommendation within two weeks. \n\n\nThe initial recommendation by the administrative office was to simply defer any \nconsideration of new deputies until the 1990-91 fiscal year. But after meeting \nwith three supervisors Wednesday -- South County representatives Gaddi H. \nVasquez and Thomas F. Riley and Board Chairman Don R. Roth -- Assistant County \nAdministrative Officer Murry L. Cable agreed to put the item on the agenda for \nthe board's March 6 meeting, with a recommendation from his office that new \nhiring be delayed. \n\n\n\"The issue needs to be deliberated in public in a board meeting,\" said Vasquez, \nwhose district includes the unincorporated communities of El Toro, Lake Forest, \nRancho Santa Margarita and Coto de Caza. \"It's something that I'm concerned \nabout.\" \n\n\nRiley, whose district includes Laguna Hills and Aliso Viejo, said he hopes that \nhe and Vasquez can persuade at least one other supervisor to approve the hiring \nthis year. \n\n\n\"The time is now,\" Riley said. \"The growth in South County is great; the needs \nare there. We sometimes think of it as a rural area when really we should think \nof it as urban.\" \n\n\nSheriff Brad Gates, who was in Los Angeles much of Wednesday and had not yet \nheard about the county administrative office recommendation, responded angrily \nwhen he heard the news. \n\n\n\"I haven't been told that,\" Gates said. \"The agreement we had with the CAO is \nthat (County Administrative Officer) Ernie Schneider was supposed to call me \nlast Friday. . . . He hasn't done that yet.\" \n\n\nSchneider is on vacation this week. Cable, as the assistant administrative \nofficer, is scheduled to meet with the two remaining supervisors, Roger R. \nStanton and Harriett M. Wieder, today. \n\n\nThe last few months have been rough going for Gates, who has increasingly found \nhimself at odds with the Board of Supervisors and the county staff over his \nbudget requests. \n\n\nLast year, some board members told Gates that the new genetics testing \nlaboratory he wanted should be paid for with money seized in drug raids. Gates \neventually got funds for the lab without using the drug-raid money. But Gates \nwas dealt another, big setback when the board voted to sell Rancho del Rio, \nwhere the sheriff had wanted to build an international narcotics enforcement \ntraining facility. \n\n\nEarlier this month, a Gates-backed plan to increase the sales tax to pay for a \nnew jail was ruled unconstitutional by a Sacramento County judge, leaving the \ncounty's plans to relieve jail overcrowding in disarray. \n\n\nCapt. Doug Storm, commander of the South County sheriff's substation in Laguna \nNiguel, said he did not want to comment on the county administrative office \nrecommendation to delay the new hires until the matter goes before the board \nnext month. \n\n\n\"We're still hopeful that something can be worked out,\" Storm said. \n\n\nAmong the three alternatives the board will consider are plans to hire 20, 39, \nor 54 new deputies, at initial costs of $1.3 million or $2.6 million or $3.6 \nmillion. \n\n\nThere are now 122 deputies to patrol South County -- the same number as in \n1984. According to a county report completed last December, population in the \narea has increased about 18% a year and calls for service have increased about \n15% per year in the unincorporated area. \n\n\nThe report also says that South County deputies spend almost 60% of their time \nresponding to calls for service and writing reports, and 13% of their time on \n\"preventive patrol\" -- that is, developing contacts, stopping people who are \nacting suspiciously and patrolling neighborhoods to seek suspects and deter \ncrime. The average response time for the highest-priority calls, including \nthose for crimes in progress, is more than eight minutes, the report says. \n\n\nThe general standard for law enforcement is to have patrol units spend between \n40% and 60% of their time on preventive patrols; the average response time for \nhighest-priority calls should be five minutes. \n\n\n\n\nCalls for Service \n\n\nNumber of calls for service received by the Orange County Sheriff's Department \nfrom South County residents.* \n\n\n'84-'85: 33,803 \n\n\n'85-\"86: 37,136 \n\n\n'86-'87: 43,603 \n\n\n'87-'88: 51,018 \n\n\n'88-'89: 58,671** \n\n\n'89-'90: 67, 472** \n\n\n*Area includes El Toro, Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, Laguan Niguel, Ailso Viejo, \nRancho Santa Margarita and canyons. \n\n\n**Projected \n\n\nSource: Orange County Sheriff's Department"}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0153", "docId": "179903", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition", "section": "Metro; Part B; Page 1; Column 6; Metro Desk", "length": "1156", "headline": "OIL IN SAND MAY KEEP BEACHES SHUT", "byline": "By ERIC BAILEY and LANIE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, Workers drag large plastic bags behind them as they continue oil spill \ncleanup of beach near the Santa Ana River jetty in Newport Beach. ROD BOREN", "text": "Just when it appeared that efforts to mop up the Orange County oil spill were \nwinding down, authorities feared Wednesday that a thin vein of crude may have \nseeped into the sand along a broad stretch of shoreline, threatening to \nindefinitely delay the opening of beaches. \n\n\nIf tests find oil lurking in more than a few isolated pockets in Huntington \nBeach and Newport Beach, officials say they would be forced to rev up the \ncleanup and possibly call in heavy equipment to tackle the oil-tainted sand, a \nprocess that could take weeks. \n\n\nKim McCleneghan, the state Department of Fish and Game's oil-spill coordinator, \nsaid the oily residue runs along about 10 miles of shoreline from Bolsa Chica \nState Beach to Newport Beach, in some spots 10 to 20 feet wide. \n\n\n\"In some areas it is heavier than others,\" McCleneghan said. \"In the sand you \ncan feel it, you can smell it.\" \n\n\nAuthorities speculated that heavy rain, strong winds and pounding waves from a \nfierce storm that lashed the Southland last weekend may have driven oil that \nhad washed ashore as much as a foot deep into the sand above the high tide \nline. \n\n\n\"I suspect this will delay the opening of the beaches,\" said Petty Officer Tim \nRowe of the U.S. Coast Guard. \"The beaches look very good on the surface. But \nright now we have to figure out what to do with the stuff underneath.\" \n\n\nWork crews began in earnest Wednesday taking samples along a six-mile stretch \nof coastline from the Huntington Beach pier to just south of the Newport Pier. \n\n\nOfficials with British Petroleum, the firm that owned the 394,000 gallons of \nAlaskan crude that spilled Feb. 7 off Huntington Beach when the tanker American \nTrader punctured its hull with an anchor, said workers were digging into the \nsand at periodic points along the shoreline to determine the extent of the \nspread. \n\n\nChuck Webster, the firm's crisis manager, said British Petroleum has \"always \nfelt we would find areas in which some subsurface penetration of oil had \noccurred. There is now evidence that the storm may have resulted in a larger \npenetration zone than initially recognized.\" \n\n\nOfficials with the state Department of Fish and Game will review the results \nfrom the survey of the sand and decide how to tackle the problem after \nconsulting with representatives of local cities, the Coast Guard and the oil \ncompany. \n\n\nIn past days, authorities have found oil \"from an inch down to four inches, a \nfairly significant amount of concentrated oil,\" said Curt Taucher, a state Fish \nand Game Department spokesman. Last week, Fish and Game officials found oil at \na depth of 15 inches, he said. In most places the ribbon of oil has been less \nthan an inch thick. \n\n\nTaucher said teams from the agency at first \"were under the impression the \nbeaches were being cleaned up satisfactorily\" but found in recent days there \nwere still significant concentrations of oil when they surveyed the area. \n\n\nAmong the options being weighed by officials is employing a tractor and disk to \nplow up the crude so it can be removed by work crews or allowed to break down \nand evaporate in the sunlight. Authorities are also considering whether to try \nusing a machine that normally picks up beach debris to sift the oil-tainted \nsand. \n\n\nMcCleneghan also said that hundreds of workers wielding shovels would dig up \nsome sections of oil-stained sand, put it in bags and have it trucked away. \n\n\nBut they appeared to have ruled out employing bulldozers to dig up large \nsections of sand and cart it off. McCleneghan said officials want to \"minimize \nthe amount of sand removed from the beaches.\" \n\n\nFor all the cleanup efforts, \"there are limitations,\" McCleneghan said. \"We \ncan't get all the oil off the sand. . . . It won't be gone. We're not going to \nphysically pick up and carry away\" all the sand. \n\n\nBut, he said, \"we're going to try\" to clean up enough oil \"so you won't be able \nto pick up a handful of sand and say this feels oily, this looks oily, this \nsmells oily.\" \n\n\nMcCleneghan said he could not estimate when the cleanup could be finished. \n\"It's not going to be months,\" he said. \"In some areas, it could be a matter of \nweeks.\" \n\n\nWebster said it is unclear how long a stretch of beach contains the layer of \noil, which mixes with sand to look like brown sugar. But the firm remains ready \nto do whatever is necessary to clean the beach, he said. \n\n\n\"The last thing we want to see are the beaches reopened, kids out there playing \nwith sandcastles and coming across oil,\" Webster said. \n\n\nSome local city officials, meanwhile, were calling on British Petroleum to \nconduct toxicity tests to ensure that the beach will be safe when the weather \nturns warm and crowds begin to hit the sand. \n\n\n\"I want to have chemical analysis done every quarter or half mile to see if \nthere's any contamination,\" Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays said. \"When I \nopen that beach, I want to make sure its safe for people to walk on.\" \n\n\nMays said he suspected all along that oil had seeped below the surface of the \nbeach, noting how he watched high winds from the weekend storm spread sand \ndrifts over sections of shoreline already covered with crude. \n\n\nOther local officials said they were pleased that British Petroleum was making \nefforts to unearth any oil that may have percolated into the sand. \n\n\n\"We are happy they are testing because we have been suspicious about the \npossibility of seepage,\" said Newport Beach City Manager Robert L. Wynn. \"We \nsuggested to BP in our meetings with them that they test for this.\" \n\n\nFish and Game marine biologist Ken Wilson was one of several experts who has \nrun across pockets of oil deep in the sand, but closer to the surf line. \n\n\nWhile digging for grunion eggs last week at Bolsa Chica State Beach, Wilson \nfound \"thin layers of what appeared to be oil-soaked sand\" about four inches \nbelow the surface. About 5 or 6 inches down the biologist discovered an \ninch-thick layer of sand saturated \"very heavily with oil.\" \n\n\n\"It wasn't gooey but you could definitely see the sand grain was discolored to \na brown,\" he said. \n\n\nThe layer of ooze could pose problems for the environment.

The council voted in support of a scaled-down \nversion of the \"restaurant row\" proposal after a long, emotional public \nhearing. \n\n\nBut Pierside Village is not in the clear yet. \n\n\nThe project cannot proceed beyond the talking stage unless the State Lands \nCommission drops its opposition to having more commercial buildings on public \nbeach right-of-way. The state panel, despite pleas and heavy lobbying by the \ncity, has so far steadfastly refused to accept the project. \n\n\nConsequently, city and state lawyers are scheduled to meet in Orange County \nSuperior Court on Friday morning in a crucial legal encounter involving \nPierside Village. \n\n\nAssistant City Atty. Robert Sangster said the city hopes to get the state's \nopposition dismissed without going to trial. \n\n\n\"Basically we're arguing that the state doesn't have any (legal) interest in \nthe property,\" he explained. \n\n\nBut Robert G. Collins, a deputy state attorney general, said he will argue that \nthe state has a vital interest in the case. The State Lands Commission has \nrights as an adjoining property owner, and the attorney general's office has \nthe legal interest of enforcing public easements, said Collins. \n\n\nAt issue in the case is a narrow, two-acre strip of paved-over beach extending \nfrom the intersection of Main Street and Pacific Coast Highway to the \nintersection of 1st (formerly Lake) Street and Pacific Coast Highway. The land \nis immediately south of the city's famous pier. The strip is the site for \nMaxwell's Restaurant and a ribbon of paved parking strips extending south to \nthe city's lifeguard headquarters. None of the land is raw sand or pristine \nbeach. \n\n\nEnvironmentalists have charged that any new commercial buildings on the beach \nwould reduce public access and would be \"visual pollution.\" \n\n\nIn rebuttal, city officials have argued that Pierside Village would be an open, \nattractive area that would enhance public access to the beach. The buildings \nwould not detract from the ocean view, the city officials have said. \n\n\nAs originally proposed in 1984, Pierside Village would have involved 87,500 \nsquare feet of restaurants and other commercial space. \n\n\nBut over the years, the project has been scaled down. As presented to the City \nCouncil on Tuesday night, the proposal called for 25,000 square feet of new \nrestaurant development, plus 15,000 square feet for a relocation of Maxwell's. \n\n\n\"This plan is definitely an improvement, but the basic problem is that it is \ninherently flawed because it puts commercial development on the beach side of \nPacific Coast Highway,\" said Councilwoman Grace Winchell. \"This beach is our \ncrown. . . . Let's not destroy the crown.\" \n\n\nWinchell and Councilman Peter M. Green cast the opposing votes against Pierside \nVillage on Tuesday. Green said the council's vote was premature since the legal \naction by the state is still pending. \n\n\nThe other five members of the council said they believe that Pierside Village \ndeserves support now. \"This is a great plan,\" said Councilman Wes Bannister. \nCouncilman John Erskine said he thought much of the opposition to the \nrestaurant proposal had been based on \"pure and unadulterated propaganda.\" \n\n\nThe vote Tuesday night does not legally commit the city to back Pierside \nVillage, according to the city attorney's office. The council's action was akin \nto a straw vote on a concept rather than a specific plan. But the vote was \npivotal in that it clearly showed a majority of the council wants to pursue the \ndevelopment. \n\n\nThe legal obstacles ahead, however, including the court action scheduled \nFriday, will determine whether the council can move ahead with Pierside \nVillage. Curtis Fossum, senior counsel for the State Lands Commission, said on \nWednesday that the state agency remains opposed to Pierside Village, regardless \nof its size. \n\n\n\"Our position is that we still must defend the public's right-of-way,\" Fossum \nsaid. \n\n\n\n\nProposed Area in Legal Tug-of-War \n\n\nProposed site for Pierside Village"}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0163", "docId": "179931", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition", "section": "Metro; Part B; Page 9; Column 2; Metro Desk", "length": "50", "headline": "BOY PLAYING WITH MATCHES BURNS FACE", "byline": null, "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "An 8-year-old boy suffered second-degree burns to his face after he apparently \nset a cologne bottle on fire, authorities said. \n\n\nThe boy, whose name was withheld because of his age, was playing with matches \nat his home in the 24600 block of Jutewood Place.

The teacher feels his pulse race \nand his temples pound. And then, even as the drama is unfolding, he starts to \ndaydream and feels an overwhelming desire to sleep. Some of his students put \ntheir heads on their desks and nod off. \n\n\nBizarre as this scenario sounds, teacher and students in this hypothetical \nscenario are demonstrating a normal human response to danger, a primal desire \nto escape through sleep, a panel of experts told school administrators from \nnine Southern California school districts Wednesday. \n\n\nThe \"Safe, Secure and Peaceful Schools Conference,\" sponsored by the Los \nAngeles County Office of Public Education and held at the Hyatt Regency \nAlicante here, presented a view of public education in America today that \nseemed anything but safe or peaceful. Topics ranged from dealing with students \nwho bring automatic weapons to class to handling bomb threats. \n\n\nViolence is on the rise in the nation's schools, and no school system, no \nmatter how suburban or middle class, is immune, experts on hostage-related \nstress warned. \n\n\n\"There is every reason to expect that the recent trends of school violence will \ncontinue to worsen . . . ,\" said a paper presented by a team of legal and \npsychiatric experts formed by the Simi Valley Unified School District. \n\n\n\"If you are an educator in an inner-city secondary school, it is likely that \nyou will need no encouragement to prepare for the threat of armed assaults and \nhostage-taking on your campus,\" the paper continued. \"However, the problem is \nnot confined to these high-risk schools.\" \n\n\nSimi Valley Police Lt. Robert Klamser, an international consultant on hostage \nnegotiating and a co-author of the paper, told the conference that 150,000 \ncrimes are committed each year in the nation's schools. In 1988, 18 classrooms \naround the country were held hostage, he noted. \n\n\nBut Klamser said 95% of all hostage situations are resolved with no loss of \nlife. In most cases, it is simply a matter of calming the captor down and then \nwaiting for him to reach a point of exhaustion, which usually comes 13 to 14 \nhours after the siege begins. \n\n\n\"The longer the bad guy and good guy are together, the less likely the bad guy \nis going to kill the good guy . . . ,\" Klamser said. \"If the hostage-taker \nwanted to commit a massacre, he would have already done it.\" \n\n\nAnthony Bonaccorso, a Simi Valley psychiatrist and a consultant on hostage \nnegotiations, advised educators to be cooperative and try to reassure a captor, \neven if they are ordered to leave their students alone with the hostage-taker. \n\n\nAuthorities in Anaheim handled the crisis admirably last October when \n15-year-old Cory Robb took a Loara High School drama class hostage with a \nshort-barreled shotgun and a .22-caliber pistol, both Bonaccorso and Klamser \nagreed. One student was injured, but no one was killed, and Robb gave himself \nup after about 40 minutes. Bonaccorso and Klamser noted that drama teacher \nKenneth Tuttle acted wisely when he left the room after Robb ordered him to do \nso. \n\n\n\"The review of these incidents shows clearly that kids are in no more danger if \nyou comply with the hostage-taker,\" Klamser said. \"If the teacher 'John Waynes' \nit, what you're doing is creating a much more dangerous situation.\" \n\n\nDuring a hostage-taking, the so-called Stockholm syndrome, in which hostages \nidentify with their captors, is common, arising from a healthy survivor \ninstinct, Bonaccorso said. Hostages often experience guilt over such feelings \nafter their release but should not, Bonaccorso said. He added that police \nwelcome such developments because they tend to defuse the situation and buy the \nnegotiators more time. \n\n\n\"Time is on your side,\" Bonaccorso told his audience. \"Exhaustion is what \npolice officers are waiting for. . . . Suddenly, we're negotiating for a \nMcDonald's hamburger and a cup of coffee.\" \n\n\nKlamser said police who are criticized in hostage situations for failing to act \nquickly enough may have simply been buying time. He noted that 85% of the \ncaptives killed during a hostage situation are slain when police attempt a \nrescue. \n\n\n\"Once we get to talking about food, it can go on and on,\" he said. \" 'Do you \nwant McDonald's or Jack-in-the-Box? Do you want it with catsup or without?' . . \n. We want to keep him making decisions because that wears him out.\" \n\n\nComplicating the task of defusing potential violence in Southern California \nschools are the maze of language and cultural barriers, several experts noted. \nJeffrey J. Munks, a former San Jose police officer and now manager of an \nemergency translation service provided by American Telephone & Telegraph \nCo., said public school teachers in the state now deal with 60 different \nlanguages and cultures. \n\n\nMunks advised teachers to brief themselves on a student's culture before trying \nto talk to his family about academic or behavior problems so as to avoid \nunintended faux pas. For example, Munks said, a teacher talking to Vietnamese \nparents might unknowingly insult them by pointing, which is reserved for \nchildren and pets in Vietnamese culture and is considered highly offensive \namong adults. \n\n\nLillie Wilson, an administrator with the Los Angeles County Department of \nEducation who helped organize Wednesday's conference, said that educators are \n\"beyond awareness\" of the potential dangers they must deal with and are now \nlooking for responses \"that work.\" \n\n\nExperts conceded, however, that some violence in the schools is beyond their \ncontrol. \n\n\n\"There wasn't much anybody at the Cleveland School could do once Patrick Purdy \nparked his car,\" Klamser said, referring to Purdy's random shooting spree on an \nelementary school playground last year in Stockton that left five students dead \nand 29 injured. \n\n\nIn their paper presented Wednesday, Klamser and his colleagues noted: \"Today's \nschools no longer represent the sort of safe and secure haven they did as \nrecently as a generation or two ago.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0165", "docId": "179933", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition", "section": "Sports; Part C; Page 1; Column 6; Sports Desk", "length": "613", "headline": "ANGELS WATCH WHILE CLARK WORKS ON PITCH", "byline": "By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, COLOR, With the Giants locked out of spring camp, Will Clark had time to \nfilm a commercial at UC Irvine.

To the eight Angels who had gone there \nWednesday to run and stretch and throw, the film crew's visit was a welcome \ndiversion from a routine that had become tiresome by the time the lockout \nreached its seventh day. \n\n\nPitcher Chuck Finley, his workout done, sat with his back against the fence and \nregarded Clark with a bemused expression. \"Well,\" he said, \"I'm glad somebody's \nworking.\" \n\n\nLeft to their own devices and consciences, the Angels worked hard enough to \nbreak a sweat during their 90-minute session at the place that has become their \nhome away from home since the lockout put Anaheim Stadium off limits. \n\n\nFinley and Jim Abbott paired off to loosen up with easy tosses that grew \nprogressively harder, breaking up the monotony with chatter about a pickup \nbasketball game Finley had played. Bert Blyleven, wearing a T-shirt imprinted \nwith the slogan \"Play Ball,\" did exactly that with reliever Willie Fraser. \n\n\n\"Throw it where I can reach it,\" Blyleven scolded after Fraser hurled a pitch \nhigh over Blyleven's head. Fraser wasn't the least bit remorseful. \"Hey, the \nfence will stop it,\" he said. \n\n\nMike Witt and Bryan Harvey wandered past the commercial set at home plate and \nheaded for the left-field bullpen, where Witt got in some throws off the mound. \nKirk McCaskill did some serious throwing in another enclosure on the first-base \nside. \n\n\nOnly shortstop Dick Schofield, the lone nonpitcher at the workout, left before \nhis teammates had finished their regimens by running in the outfield. Schofield \nsays he has felt the effects of the lockout less than the pitchers because \nalthough pitchers and catchers would normally have reported to spring training \na week ago, the earliest all other players were permitted to report was today. \n\n\n\"There's nothing to do here,\" Schofield said. \"It hasn't gotten to me yet \nbecause (Thursday) I'd just be leaving for spring training. The pitchers are \nthe ones it's bothering.

AURELIO \nJOSE BARRERA / Los Angeles Times", "text": "Traditional blues is difficult to play convincingly, and it certainly isn't one \nof the more financially rewarding branches of music. It's not surprising, then, \nthat most of the musicians who play the deep blues say they didn't take it up \nas a matter of choice. \n\n\nInstead, some compulsion in the music pulled them in, ears first. Maybe it was \nthe resonance of a quavering slide guitar, or the mystery in a drawled, \nincantatory vocal cry. In any case, something inside answers to the depths of \nhistory and culture and the wells of elemental emotion embedded in the blues, \nand it sets the listener on a lifetime course. Robert Lucas says that is how it \nhappened with him. \n\n\nAt 27, a relative youngster on a local blues scene populated mostly by veterans \nin their 30s and 40s, Lucas has just released his first album, \"Across the \nRiver.\" For his debut, the Huntington Beach resident recorded the most basic, \ntraditional kind of blues there is -- solo, acoustic performances steeped in \nthe Delta style that came out of backwoods Mississippi in the 1920s and 1930s. \n\n\nLucas, who also fronts an electric blues band, Luke & the Locomotives, will \nplay a solo show tonight at Cagney's in Huntington Beach, where he is the host \nof a regular \"Open Mic Night\" every Thursday. \n\n\nLucas is a big man with exceptionally thick fingers and a hulking build. \nSitting at a front table in Cagney's long, rectangular barroom, he talked about \nthe blues in a low, gravelly speaking voice that was a harbinger of the deep, \nfull moan that comes out when he sings. \n\n\n\"I was lucky. . . . I got turned on to a Robert Johnson record when I was very \nyoung,\" he said. \"Actually, (traditional blues) is all I ever wanted to play.\" \n\n\nLucas, who grew up in Long Beach, was in his mid-teens, listening to \nblues-based rockers like Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix when he came across his \nfirst acoustic blues song, \"Turtle Blues,\" on the Janis Joplin/Big Brother \n& the Holding Company \"Cheap Thrills\" album. The song struck him deeply \nenough to trigger a special trip to his local record shop. \n\n\nLucas told the shopkeeper that he wanted to find out more about the sound \nbehind the Joplin song. \"I asked the guy, 'What is this, and why does it sound \nlike that? And where can I get more records like this?' \" The clerk recommended \nalbums by fundamental bluesmen Leroy Carr and Robert Johnson. It was Johnson's \n\"King of the Delta Blues Singers,\" probably the greatest album in any pop \ncategory, that grabbed Lucas by the ear. \n\n\n\"I didn't know anything about blues. I put the record on with a totally blank \nmind, thinking, 'What is this?' The way (Johnson) phrased his words, I never \nheard music with so much feeling. I'd never felt music before, until I heard \nthat stuff. There's a certain eeriness. I could actually see myself being \nthere.\" \n\n\nLucas rejected all the other pop music of the day (which wasn't that big a \nsacrifice in 1976) and dove into collecting old blues records. \"I was pretty \nsnobby when I was in high school,\" he said. \"I used to rant and rave about it.\" \nHe took up the guitar for a while, then set it aside and switched to harmonica, \nwhich remains his primary instrument. At 19, his search for a guitar teacher \nwho could show him Robert Johnson-style acoustic slide guitar techniques led \nhim to Bernie Pearl, the Long Beach blues band leader and KLON disc jockey. \nLucas got his lessons, plus a two-year hitch as a harmonica-playing sideman in \nPearl's band. \n\n\nWanting to step out as a front man, Lucas joined the Confessors, a R&B band \nwhose repertoire included songs by such master soul singers as James Brown, \nJackie Wilson and Wilson Pickett. \"At the time I didn't like (R&B),\" Lucas \nsaid. \"I just wanted to play blues, but it helped me get my vocal chops \ntogether because that stuff is hard to sing.\" \n\n\nEarly in 1986, he formed Luke & the Locomotives. After three years of busy \ngigging, the band mustered financing to make its first record. But last summer, \njust as it was on the verge of recording, Lucas decided that the music was all \nwrong, fired the entire band and started over from scratch. \n\n\n\"The band progressively had turned into a kind of Southern rock band,\" said \nLucas, whose vision for Luke & the Locomotives had been a more traditional, \nTexas- and Chicago-blues sound. \"No matter what I tried, it always ended up \nsounding like the Allman Brothers, and I didn't want to do that.\" Firing the \nband \"was one of the hardest things I ever did. One of the guitar players \n(Robert Lieberman) had been my friend for 10 years, and we're not really \nfriends now, as you can imagine. But the music is more important to me than all \nthat buddy-buddy stuff.\" \n\n\nDuring the next two months, Lucas put together a new band of Locomotives -- \nguitarists Paul Bryant and Rick Gould, bassist Al (Bedrock) Bedrosian and \ndrummer Bob Ebersol, who goes by the stage name Max Bangwell. All of them are \nat least 10 years older than Lucas. \"When I got the new guys,\" Lucas said, \"I \ngot people playing just what I wanted them to, without me having to say \nanything to them. It's been the easiest, most stress-free six months of my \nlife.\" \n\n\nThe changeover period, and a scaled-down performing schedule since then, gave \nLucas more time to concentrate on solo acoustic performances -- which led to \n\"Across The River,\" a self-financed cassette album that he recorded on a $1,500 \nbudget in one day, without overdubs. \n\n\n\"Just like Robert Johnson in the hotel room in San Antonio,\" Lucas said, \nreferring to the ad-hoc circumstances behind the only surviving recording \nsessions of Johnson's career. Lucas' album includes remakes of two of Johnson's \nclassics, \"Terraplane Blues\" and \"Crossroads,\" as well as songs by John Lee \nHooker, Muddy Waters and Fred McDowell. \n\n\n\"It's not just me redoing it to see how much I can sound like (Howlin') Wolf or \nRobert Johnson,\" Lucas said. \"This is my interpretation. It's sounding like \nmyself and keeping the idiom alive with things that are fresh.\" The album's \ntitle track, one of three Lucas originals, is something fresh, a fine blues \nthat, in the best tradition of the style, is drawn from real-life observation. \n\n\n\"A girl I knew in high school became addicted to cocaine, and she became a \nprostitute,\" Lucas said, explaining the song's background. \"I'd see her working \nthe streets in Compton. Seeing a girl you knew in high school out on Long Beach \nBoulevard flagging down cars to make 20 bucks, it's kind of a sad situation.\" \nLucas invested the song with added emotional resonance by writing it from the \ntortured perspective of a man in love with the streetwalker. Like everything \nelse on \"Across the River,\" the title song comes across in a voice that sounds \ntimeless and ancient -- a throwback to Lucas' original inspirations. \n\n\nLucas sees the album as a modest first step on a long road toward his goal of \nrecording for a high-profile blues specialty label and establishing his band as \na touring act (Luke & the Locomotives are planning to record early in \nMarch). \"It's part of the dues-paying process,\" Lucas said. \"You've gotta put \nout a couple albums yourself to show 'em you're serious. \n\n\n\"I would like a major label to come in and say, 'You're going to be the next \nRobert Cray,' but I don't want to have any futile illusions. The whole key to \ndoing this for a long time is keeping your attitude right. If you say, 'I'm \ngoing to be the next John Mayall,' you're setting yourself up for a fall.\" \n\n\nMeanwhile, with some bill-paying help from his girlfriend, Lucas has been \nearning a living playing the blues since early 1987, when he quit his job as a \nmunicipal maintenance man for the city of Long Beach. That, he figures, is a \npretty significant accomplishment in itself. \n\n\nRobert Lucas plays solo tonight (and every Thursday) at 9:30 as host of Open \nMic Night at Cagney's, 406 N.

Yet such hurdles as lack of community, growing pressures to conform, \nsubtle forms of censorship, a steamroller mass culture and a lack of social \nalternatives for the smart and the cool may have helped to spark a resurgence \nin the local poetry scene. \n\n\n\"People are tired of not thinking,\" said Lee Clark, a Long Beach musician and \npoet. \"People really want this. There's people here that I haven't seen in \nyears.\" \n\n\nLee Mallory, a poet and professor for the Rancho Santiago Community College in \nSanta Ana, explained why he attended: \"People are spiritually empty. Poets are \nthe cutting edge of consciousness. The poet is a subversive, but always for the \ngood.\" \n\n\nBecause the organizers are hoping to foster a greater sense of literary \npreparedness, it is no small poetic coincidence that their logo for the Cafe of \nDreams closely resembles that of the Civil Defense. \n\n\n\"It's stuff you've never heard before,\" audience member Jessica Iverson said. \n\"You're going to hear it for the first time and probably the last time. You'll \nprobably forget most of it, but some of it you will remember.\" \n\n\nMuch was made Monday of the prospect of a freewheeling, uncensored poetry scene \ndeveloping in a conservative bedroom community such as Orange County. Poet Joe \nWilliams drew laughter and applause in proclaiming: \"This is Orange County and \nthe multitudes have come to a poetry reading. Orange County isn't what it used \nto be.\" \n\n\nThe poetry was as varied as the audience, which was made up of young and old, \nthe colorful and the staid. In the course of the 2 1/2-hour evening, topics \nincluded lost love, alienation, social ills, humor, male foibles, parents and, \nnaturally, freeway driving. \n\n\n\"This is essential in Orange County,\" said Mark Carranza, of the Institute for \nthe Prevention of Design, one of the event's sponsors. A computer consultant by \nday, Carranza has organized poetry readings at laundromats, industrial \ncomplexes, the beach and other less likely places. \n\n\n\"Orange County is the land of the living dead,\" said Carranza. \"There is \nnothing else.\" \n\n\nKathi Georges, a graphic designer and another of the series organizers, said \nshe believes that the poetry readings fill a necessary niche in Orange County's \nevolving culture. \"I think it's very important. There's a new tendency to \nconformity. You need to have that other outlet.\" \n\n\nIn contrast to the dark, smoky coffeehouses of beat-generation legend, there \nwas an exuberance and lack of pretension at the Cafe of Dreams. Tables and \nchairs sat half the audience, while others made do on makeshift benches of wood \nplanks across milk crates. Some listened from the second-floor balcony. \n\n\nFlamenco guitarists John Schuster and Jon Bryant began the evening and were \nfollowed by featured poets Mitch Teemley and Joe Williams. The evening ended \nafter several members of the audience volunteered to share their recent work, \nsome of it written that evening. \n\n\n\"People can come here and find community sustenance,\" said Martin Diedrich, \nhost of the event, held the third Monday of each month at 8 p.m. \"This is very \nmuch a community event.\" \n\n\nThe owner of the bright, upscale Costa Mesa shop as well as a second location \nin Tustin, Diedrich represents the third generation in his family to enter the \ncoffee business. He grew up on his family's coffee plantation in Guatemala and \nmissed the sense of community he knew there. \n\n\n\"In coming to Orange County, for years I really felt lost,\" he said. \"I feel \nI'm successful if people can come here and have a good time.\" He said his goal \nis to capture the atmosphere of the traditional European coffeehouse, \"not the \nfancy, artsy stuff you see in Los Angeles.\" \n\n\nGeorges said she believes that the crowds are larger for Orange County poetry \nreadings than those in Los Angeles, perhaps because there are fewer venues for \npoetry here, thus concentrating the audiences. \n\n\nFor those who read new cultural events like tea leaves, the success of local \npoetry readings may bode significant cultural changes ahead. \"It's nice to go \nsomeplace other than a (rock) concert,\" Lee Clark said. \"People can come \ntogether here, where you can't hear each other talk at a concert.

Their \nsongs have been covered by a wealth of other artists, including Hank Williams \nJr., Bonnie Raitt, Dave Edmunds, the Box Tops and the Carpenters. \n\n\nColumbia Records once hyped them as the \"new Beatles,\" and their peer-group \nadmirers include Keith Richards and R.E.M., with whom they spent two months on \nthe road last year. \n\n\nYet the members of NRBQ have never even come close to having a hit record, and \ntheir live appearances as headliners are still confined to nightclubs, \nincluding tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. \n\n\nWith the recent release of the album \"Wild Weekend,\" however, Terry Adams -- \nthe group's co-founder, lead singer and keyboard player -- believes that NRBQ's \nlong-awaited commercial breakthrough is finally at hand. \n\n\n\"I just think our time has come,\" he said. \"It's our first studio album in five \nyears, we've got a major label (Virgin Records) behind us, and I have a feeling \npeople are going to pick up on it.\" \n\n\nIf NRBQ does make it big, it won't be because of any shift in musical \ndirection. It's still playing the same eclectic mix of rock 'n' roll, country, \njazz and rhythm and blues it has always played. \n\n\n\"Our sound hasn't changed; it's just gotten better,\" Adams said. \"We're not \ngoing to change to suit somebody else's idea of what's in; we believe in \nplaying (for) ourselves and waiting for people to catch on. \n\n\n\"We're all natural musicians; it's the only job we've ever had, and none of us \nhas ever held down a regular job. This is what we do -- we're out there \ntogether, playing our sound.\" \n\n\nThe unique NRBQ sound is based on segregation rather than integration, Adams \nsaid. \n\n\n\"When you take something like fusion, you get neither jazz nor rock 'n' roll,\" \nhe said. \"And to me, that's no fun -- I'd rather hear someone play a jazz tune \nright and then a rock 'n' roll tune right. \n\n\n\"It's like, if you're a painter, and you take all your colors and dump them \ninto one thing, you get dull gray. It's better to reserve the right color for \nthe right moment. \n\n\n\"We use every color that God gave us, whenever we feel like it, but instead of \nmixing everything together, we play everything pure -- the songs on our albums \nare mainly rock, but we might throw in a country tune or a jazz tune just to \nkeep it interesting.\" \n\n\nNRBQ stands for New Rhythm and Blues Quintet, though the group today has four \nmembers. It was formed in 1967, when Adams and a fellow Kentucky native, \nguitarist Steve Ferguson, met Bronx-born bassist Joey Spampinato in Miami. \n\n\nWith singer Frank Gadler and drummer Tom Staley, they began playing together in \nMiami nightclubs and gradually made their way north to New Jersey, where blues \nman Slim Harpo saw them in 1968. \n\n\nHarpo got them booked into New York's prestigious Scene, and within months they \nwere signed by Columbia Records, which in 1969 released the band's debut album. \n\n\nNRBQ's 1970 follow-up, \"Boppin' the Blues,\" was a collaboration with rockabilly \nlegend Carl Perkins; like the group's first album, it was a critical triumph \nbut a commercial bomb. \n\n\nColumbia subsequently dropped NRBQ, and the group recorded its next two albums \nfor Kama Sutra Records. After a three-year sabbatical, NRBQ resurfaced in 1977 \nwith \"All Hopped Up\" on its own Red Rooster label; since then, it's released \nseveral more albums -- on Mercury, Rounder and Bearsville -- and toured \nincessantly, averaging upward of 180 gigs a year. (Al Anderson joined the group \nin 1971, and Ferguson and Gadler later quit. Tom Ardolino replaced Staley.) \n\n\n\"We literally live on the road,\" Adams said. \"None of the band members live in \nthe same state, and when we do go home, it's to pick up our mail and change \nsocks. \n\n\n\"Touring not only keeps us young and healthy -- whenever I come to California, \nthe first thing I do is go to the Beverly Hills Juice Club and grab some \nwheatgrass juice -- but that's how we get the music out there.\" \n\n\nOccasionally, NRBQ members have called time out to pursue individual projects. \n\n\nIn 1977, Adams toured Europe with Carla Bley. Two years later, he compiled \nThelonious Monk's \"Always Know\" album.

I plan on being on the road for about 2 1/2 days with some frequent \nstops. He is about 6 years old and seems to be perfectly healthy. \n\n\nTanya Simms, Seal Beach \n\n\nA: If you have enough time before your journey, you might try taking your cat \nfor a couple of short-duration car rides in the new carrier to see how well he \ntravels. You should put a favorite blanket or towel in the carrier for him to \nhide under as well as a toy or two to keep him company. I recommend that you \nfeed him about six to eight hours before the trip and give him a small amount \nof water at each stop. It might not be necessary to keep a litter box in the \ncarrier unless you are planning long stretches of driving without a stop. \nOtherwise, give him a box to use at the stops or when you stop for the night. \n\n\nIf he still has a very stressful time in the new carrier, you should have him \nchecked by your veterinarian before getting any sedatives. Make sure you have a \ncopy of his vaccinations, especially rabies, when you travel, and if he needs \nany medication, get an adequate supply to last for the length of your stay. \nGood luck. \n\n\nQ: When I first got my cat, I left food out and he started to gain weight, so I \nwent to feeding him only twice a day.

If you want to go back to free feeding, you will first need to \nmeasure the amount of food that you leave out for him each day. \n\n\nYou might try the free choice feeding for two weeks and then weigh him again. \nIf his weight stays constant at the desired level, then continue to feed this \nmeasured amount. If his weight goes up, you must decrease his food by a small \namount and then feed this new level daily. \n\n\nBy monitoring his weight and the amount fed, you can control his diet and keep \nhim being a healthy cat.

The 55-year-old Newport \nBeach stockbroker is on a diet-exercise program.", "text": "Since he started a new diet and exercise program last November, Kae Ewing's \nbiggest problem has been motivation. He wanted to lose weight and get in shape, \nbut there just didn't seem to be room in his busy schedule for regular exercise \nsessions. \n\n\nAs a result, the 55-year-old Newport Beach stockbroker, who agreed to let \nHealth & Fitness follow his progress, has been frustrated because there \nhasn't been as much progress as he had hoped. \n\n\nIn the first two months of the program, he lost 14 pounds, and in the third \nmonth he dropped aonly a single pound. \n\n\nSince then, the numbers have been moving again -- but in the wrong direction. \n\n\nEven though he's been sticking religiously to the low fat, high \ncomplex-carbohydrate diet recommended by his fitness consultant, Ewing has \nstarted gaining again and now weighs in at about 250, up from a low in January \nof 243. The 6-foot, 3 1/2-inch Lido Island resident's original goal, on the \nadvice of fitness consultant Joe Dillon of Irvine's Body Accounting, was 203 \npounds. \n\n\nInstead of exercising five or six times a week, as Dillon recommends, Ewing has \nmanaged only one or two sessions a week. \n\n\nBut last week, Ewing may have found the motivation he needs, in the form of \nsome electronic squiggles so slight even the doctor didn't notice them at first \nglance. \n\n\nThe squiggles showed up on an electrocardiogram taken while Ewing walked, then \njogged on a treadmill at the UC Irvine Executive Health Program. Although Ewing \nhad no symptoms or history of heart problems or any other chronic ailments, \nDillon recommended that he undergo a health screening just to be sure. \n\n\nIt's something he suggests for all his clients, Dillon says, \"But it's \nespecially important for somebody like Kae, who has been sedentary for a long \ntime, who's a male over 40 and who is significantly overweight.\" \n\n\nAs we are reminded every February during National Heart Month, heart and \ncirculatory diseases are the nation's top killers, accounting for nearly 50% of \nall deaths. The UCI program also screens for other problems such as diabetes, \ncancer and their precursors. \n\n\nBut wouldn't Ewing have noticed something -- pain, shortness of breath, high \nblood pressure -- if he had a serious problem? \n\n\nNot necessarily, says Dr. James Lindberg, medical director of the UCI program. \n\"In 40% of cases, the first symptom of heart disease is sudden death,\" he says. \n\n\nUnlike some busy executives who never find the time for a checkup, Ewing had \nundergone treadmill tests before, always with normal results. But this time, \nthe tracings of his heartbeat showed slight changes as he exercised, changes \nthat Lindberg says \"might indicate there's some coronary artery disease.\" The \ncoronary arteries supply oxygenated blood to the heart muscle, and when they \nbecome blocked, heart attacks can occur. \n\n\n\"It's nothing definite, but it does warrant further investigation,\" Lindberg \nsays. He glanced at the electrocardiogram tracings immediately after the test, \nbut \"the changes were so slight I didn't even notice them at first,\" he says. \n\n\nThe treadmill test was part of the UCI program's comprehensive evaluation of \ncurrent health, which includes an individualized battery of tests based on a \nperson's age, sex and condition. In addition to the usual medical examinations \nsuch as blood tests, thyroid tests, urinalysis, blood pressure checks, the \nExecutive Health Program also takes into account such factors as stress level \non and off the job and even whether the person wears a seat belt regularly in \nthe car. \n\n\nAfter the results from all the tests are in, Lindberg will sit down with Ewing \nfor a one-hour review of the findings and prepare a thick, bound personal \nhealth profile for him, spelling out Ewing's chances of dying of a heart \nattack, various forms of cancer or a motor vehicle accident within the next \ndecade or so. The profile will also include a specific prescription for \nexercise, based on Ewing's current condition and capacity. \n\n\nBut Lindberg isn't waiting for the numbers to come back from the lab. \n\n\nImmediately after he looked at the electrocardiogram printout and saw the \nirregularities, he made arrangements to send Ewing to UCI Medical Center in \nOrange for further tests. The first step, he says, will be another, more \nsophisticated treadmill test, and if that confirms Lindberg's findings, the \nnext step would be an angiogram, in which doctors at UCI would inject dye into \nEwing's coronary arteries while a special X-ray machine displays and records \nthe results. \n\n\nIf there is a blockage in one or more of Ewing's coronary arteries, doctors may \nbe able to remove it without major surgery by using a technique such as balloon \nangioplasty, in which a tiny balloon is inserted in the artery and then \ninflated to flatten out the blockage. \n\n\nOf course, there's a chance that those suspicious squiggles amount to nothing \nmore than a false alarm. Lindberg says there's roughly a 20% chance that the \nresults are a false positive and Ewing has no coronary artery disease. \n\n\nNo matter what the doctors ultimately conclude, Ewing says the preliminary \nresults have made a difference already. \"When Dr. Lindberg called and told me, \nit was like when you hit the jackpot on a pinball machine, you know, how all \nthe lights flash and the bells go off? And I thought, 'Maybe that's why I \nshould lose weight.' Whether they find something this time or not, this brings \nit home that being overweight has to be a health hazard. Maybe this is what I \nneeded to get me motivated.\" \n\n\nIn a couple of weeks, we'll check back with Ewing and find out what the other \ntest results showed."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0183", "docId": "179981", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Sports; Part C; Page 2; Column 1; Sports Desk", "length": "684", "headline": "DOUGLAS SIGNS FOR MIRAGE FIGHT;", "byline": "By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, Buster Douglas", "text": "Buster Douglas signed a \"conditional contract\" Wednesday to defend his \nheavyweight boxing championship at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas in September, \na fight that will pay him a record $25 million. \n\n\nA Mirage spokesman said the contract Douglas signed was contingent on Douglas' \nbreaking his contract with promoter Don King, and that Douglas and the Mirage \nhad filed suit against King Wednesday. \n\n\n\"Buster Douglas and the Mirage, as co-plaintiffs, today filed suit against Don \nKing, seeking to break a promotional agreement King has with Douglas,\" Mirage \nspokesman Alan Feldman said. \n\n\nLas Vegas promoter Bob Arum, New York promoter Shelly Finkel and Douglas' camp \nall said that John Johnson, Douglas' manager, and Mirage owner Steve Wynn had \ncompleted a deal. \n\n\nDouglas, who made $1.3 million in knocking out Mike Tyson Feb. 11, would earn \nboxing's biggest purse for his first defense, most likely against No. 1 \ncontender Evander Holyfield. One rumor had it that a two-fight deal was in the \nworks, with former champion Mike Tyson meeting the Douglas-Holyfield winner. \n\n\nIf the Mirage-Douglas deal is indeed made, Douglas' September payday will \nexceed the record $21 million reportedly paid to Tyson after his 1988 knockout \nof Michael Spinks. \n\n\nAccording to Arum, Wynn and Johnson signed an agreement Wednesday afternoon. \nAnd Arum said that he has a handshake deal to promote the fight and distribute \nthe pay-per-view telecast. \n\n\n\"Wynn has guaranteed Douglas $25 million,\" Arum said. \"They signed an agreement \nfor Douglas to fight in September against Holyfield or another opponent.\" \n\n\nJohnson acknowledged after the Tokyo fight that Douglas had signed a \npromotional contract with King, in the event he defeated Tyson. But Johnson \nsaid King breached his legal standing with Douglas by attempting to have the \nDouglas-Tyson result overturned in the hours after Douglas' victory. \n\n\nKing and the Tyson camp claimed that Mexican referee Octavio Meyran had \nblundered by giving Douglas a long count when Tyson knocked him down in the \neighth round. \n\n\nJohnson's son and Douglas' assistant manager, John Johnson Jr., said Wednesday \nthat a deal had been completed. \n\n\n\"It'll be September and Buster will get $25 million,\" he said. \"Dad and Buster \nwere to come back to Columbus and talk over everything, but things are moving \npretty quickly. It's possible everything could be signed Thursday.\" \n\n\nFaced with covering Douglas' guarantee, Arum said the promotion of Douglas' \nfirst defense will be a huge undertaking. \n\n\n\"It'll have to be the biggest-grossing fight in history just to break even,\" \nArum said. \n\n\nThere was no word Wednesday as to what Holyfield would earn for a fight with \nDouglas. But before Tyson-Douglas he had signed for a June 18 fight with Tyson \nthat would have paid him $12 million, and Tyson $22 million to $25 million. \n\n\nShelly Finkel, New York rock-concert promoter and pay-per-view TV syndicator, \nsaid Johnson had told him Tuesday night he had cut a deal with Wynn. \n\n\n\"I told John that September is a problem for Holyfield's people and he \nunderstands that. I told him we ought to look at what kind of money is out \nthere (for Douglas-Holyfield) before we discuss the September date.\" \n\n\nFrom the outset, Wynn seemed to have been the bidding leader for Douglas' first \ndefense. In fact, the red carpet reached all the way from Las Vegas to \nColumbus, Ohio. \n\n\nLast Sunday, Wynn arrived in Columbus in his private jet, a 26-seat DC-9, \npicked up Douglas and Johnson, and flew them to Las Vegas. Two hours after \narriving, Douglas and Johnson had prime seats, with Wynn, for the Siegfried and \nRoy show at the Mirage. \n\n\nDan Duva, Holyfield's promoter, was unavailable for comment Wednesday. But a \nspokeswoman for his firm, Main Events, said Duva remains strongly opposed to a \nSeptember fight with Douglas. \n\n\n\"If it turns out September is non-negotiable, I'm sure he'd discuss it,\" said \nEllen Krudys. \"But he definitely feels very strongly that the fight should be \nin June.\" \n\n\nHolyfield will be Douglas' opponent in September, Arum said. \n\n\n\"They may not like the date, but they'll take the fight,\" he said.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0184", "docId": "179982", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Sports; Part C; Page 2; Column 1; Sports Desk", "length": "75", "headline": "TYSON'S SISTER IS DEAD AT 24", "byline": "By Associated Press", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "The 24-year-old sister of Mike Tyson, former heavyweight boxing champion, died \nWednesday of what appeared to be a heart attack. \n\n\nDenise Anderson, who was found unconscious by her husband in their home in \nQueens, weighed between 300 and 400 pounds, said police spokesman Officer Ralph \nSt. Just. \n\n\nTyson, 23, lost his boxing title Feb. 11, when he was knocked out in the 10th \nround by Buster Douglas in Tokyo, in one of boxing's biggest upsets."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0185", "docId": "179983", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Sports; Part C; Page 2; Column 1; Sports Desk", "length": "444", "headline": "MORNING BRIEFING: GOOD-NEIGHBOR POLICY GOT HIM TO GEORGETOWN", "byline": "By GARR KLUENDER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "Sometimes it pays to have a nosy neighbor. \n\n\nWhen Anthony Allen was becoming a high school standout in Port Arthur, Tex., a \nneighbor, James Washington, decided to become involved in planning his college \ncareer -- without telling Allen. \n\n\nWashington, 69, told Steve Berkowitz of the Washington Post: \n\n\n\"I used to look at the games on TV, and the announcers would say how many of \nGeorgetown's players completed their educations. \n\n\n\"I was trying to get (Allen) recognized by a school that would make sure he \nwould come out with a degree. \n\n\n\"Starting when he was a junior, whenever I saw something in the newspaper I \nthought might be of interest, I'd cut it out and send it to Coach (John) \nThompson.

He was two for 14 \nand had only four points in 28 minutes. \n\n\nThe hot Pacers made 15 of their first 19 shots to build a big early lead, with \nReggie Miller getting seven points in the first three minutes.

Their split sparked frenzied \nmedia attention, but some New Yorkers find the saga tiresome. GARY FRIEDMAN / \nLos Angeles Times", "text": "\"If this were Mr. Cohen and Mrs. Cohen, who would care?\" -- Sarah Frantz, \nlifelong New Yorker \n\n\nEnough already. \n\n\nIt's been 12 days since news of the Great Divorce first rocked Gotham. Twelve \nlong days since New York went bonkers over the breakup of mega-developer Donald \nTrump and his Czechoslovakian wife, Ivana. Since then, Trumpmania has become a \nway of life. \n\n\nThe city's warring tabloids and talk shows have shifted into overdrive, chasing \na daily story that reeks of sex, power, greed and revenge. Should Ivana get \nmore than the $25 million promised her in a prenuptial agreement? Will Donald \nlose control of his $1.7-billion empire? Can we believe those rumors about the \nOther Woman, a blond knockout named Marla Maples? \n\n\nGossip columnists have taken sides in the first great marital tiff of the '90s, \nand on some mornings the steamy story has blown all other news off the front \npages. \n\n\nLooking for the latest from Eastern Europe? Get real. Nelson Mandela's release? \nPlease turn to page 15. \n\n\nBut take it from the hard-working stiffs of New York, the $20,000-a-year folks \nwho trudge to work each day past the screaming headlines: The Trump story is \nbeginning to get old. \n\n\nOn a cold, blustery afternoon, Yusef Achmed stands in front of the posh Plaza \nHotel as he always does, selling hot dogs and dispensing wisdom. Trump, The \nDivorce, is roaring into its second week, but Achmed couldn't care less. \n\n\n\"In my country, in Egypt, this could never be,\" he says, slapping a pink dog \ninto a steaming bun. \"Here, the rich are crazy. A man leaves his wife. A woman \ncries her heart out. And they do this in public, all of it, in newspapers.\" \n\n\nAcross the street, Jesse Stearns waits for passengers to hitch a ride past \nTrump's luxurious hotel and through Central Park in a horse-drawn carriage. He, \ntoo, is weary of the story. \n\n\n\"This guy Trump is a real piece of work, and his wife's no bargain either,\" \nStearns says, stamping his feet to ward off the cold. \"I'm tired of 'em both, \nyou know? I'm tired of the whole damn thing.\" \n\n\nBut even Stearns says he reads each new installment with fascination. Like many \nNew Yorkers, he has taken Ivana's side, saying she should get more from \"The \nDonald,\" as Ivana has dubbed him. He relishes the prospect that the brash \n44-year-old developer might actually lose for a change. \n\n\nThanks to the press, Trump vs. Trump seems to be getting hotter as it rolls \ninto Week 3. \n\n\nLast weekend, the tabloids sent squads of reporters to Palm Beach to cover \nDonald and Ivana's chilly vacation -- in separate beds -- at their 118-room \nestate. Trump denies that he has been unfaithful to Ivana, 41, but Maples' \nfriends have told reporters that the 26-year-old actress-model is \"obsessed\" \nwith the developer. \n\n\nOn Tuesday, the papers breathlessly reported that Trump had hired a team of \nthree bodyguards to hustle Maples in and out of hotel rooms, to make sure she \nnever bumped into Ivana. Meanwhile, a society writer explained that Ivana would \nhave to \"cut corners\" if she hoped to maintain her exclusive life style on only \n$25 million. \n\n\nOn Wednesday, Ivana's lawyer announced he was no longer speaking to Donald's \nlawyer. \n\n\nThe Trumps have deplored all of the publicity, blasting the media for lack of \ngood taste and restraint. But behind the scenes, their high-priced lawyers and \npublicists -- and a rapidly multiplying number of anonymous sources -- have \nbeen whipping the press into a feeding frenzy. \n\n\n\"Best Sex I Ever Had,\" screamed the New York Post last week, hyping a comment \nthat Maples reportedly made about her boudoir romps with Trump. \"A real peach,\" \nleered the Daily News, probing her years as a cheerleader and high school \nbasketball player in Dalton, Ga. \n\n\nAs they dish the dirt, gossip queens Liz Smith of the Daily News and Cindy \nAdams of the Post have hooked up with the rival camps -- Liz with Ivana, Cindy \nwith Donald -- and are even firing shots at each other. Last week, the Daily \nNews invited New Yorkers to write letters to the feuding couple and printed the \nbest ones. Not to be outdone, New York Newsday ran a gaudy cartoon on its front \npage lampooning the whole affair. \n\n\nEven Maples has gotten into the act, hiring a lawyer to squelch stories and \nracy modeling photos that have been popping up in the tabloids. She also has a \npress agent, reportedly on Trump's payroll, who tells reporters that she is \n\"The Marilyn Monroe of the '90s.\" \n\n\nThe soap opera is getting dirtier by the day, and prominent celebrities have \nplunged into the suds. Leona Helmsley, the serpent-tongued hotel magnate who \nwas convicted for tax fraud, lashed out at Trump in an interview published last \nweekend and said his wife deserves more money. Cardinal John J. O'Connor, \nurging calm, has publicly counseled both Trumps to pray. \n\n\n\"This whole thing is out of control,\" boxing promoter Irving Rudd says as he \nmuscles his way through a sandwich in a mid-town deli. \"We had Trump at a press \nconference the other day to promote a boxing match with Thomas Hearns, and 25 \ntelevision cameras showed up. Do you think they cared about the boxing match? \nI'm getting tired of this.\" \n\n\nSo are the little people, as Helmsley once called those who pay taxes. \n\n\nAn impromptu public opinion survey this week in New York and on the Atlantic \nCity boardwalk showed growing support for Ivana -- but even more, a belief that \nthe whole story has been blown out of proportion. \n\n\n\"I think there are so many more important things going on than this,\" says \nRoberta Washington from Brooklyn, as she waits for a bus to take her home from \nthe Trump Plaza Casino. \"The homeless, crime in the street. And here are these \ntwo people with millions of dollars, fighting for even more.\" \n\n\nWashington gathers up her handbag and coat and announces that she has nothing \nmore to say. Then, she adds in a whisper: \"I hope she takes him to the \ncleaners.\" \n\n\nBack in New York, taxi driver Debra Augustus laughs at the big story as he \ncruises past the glitzy Trump Tower building on Fifth Avenue. For Augustus, a \nnative of Ghana, Trump vs. Trump is something uniquely American -- and \ntherefore bizarre. \n\n\n\"I think she should get more,\" he says with a smirk. \"Maybe $100 million. No, \nmaybe $200 million. Throw in the hotel, too? OK, throw in the hotel. Whatever \nyou say.\" \n\n\nSwerving to avoid a pedestrian, Augustus looks up at the shimmering golden \nfacade of Trump's high-rise building and laughs again. \n\n\n\"People are rooting for her, I guess, but does it matter? It is a fairy tale. I \nam still looking for my fortune, and I work very hard. I have no time for fairy \ntales.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0196", "docId": "180012", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "View; Part E; Page 3; Column 1; View Desk", "length": "519", "headline": "ART BUCHWALD: HOW TO PREDICT THE UNPREDICTABLE", "byline": "By ART BUCHWALD", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "Presidents of the United States are not the only ones who hire soothsayers to \ntell them what the future will bring.

I was sitting in the anteroom of \nHeinrich Applebaum's \"Made-to-Order Quality Predictions\" when Willard Dergen, \nCEO of Stardust Avionics, charged in. He wanted to know why he hadn't been \ninformed about the overthrow of the old regime in Czechoslovakia, and its \nreplacement with a playwright, when he had paid Heinrich a fee of $750,000. \n\n\nHeinrich smiled, as he usually does when stuck in a corner, and replied, \"We \ndidn't want to bother you with something so insignificant. Czechoslovakia is \nsuch a little country, it can't affect anything.\" \n\n\nWillard spluttered and said, \"Why did I have to find out on CNN that Romania \nwas about to fall and its leader had been killed? Your job is to let me know \nwho is going to get killed in Romania.\" \n\n\n\"Willard, we didn't want to go off the deep end until our CIA sources confirmed \nit for us. One thing we don't do at Applebaum Predictions is fax a client for \nthe sake of faxing him.\" \n\n\n\"This may sound strange to you, but I don't like to spend $2 million a year and \nnot even know about the fall of the Berlin Wall. Why didn't you people inform \nus that the wall was going to be torn down?\" \n\n\n\"The East Germans gave us their word that the wall would stay forever. But they \ndouble-crossed us to suck up to West Germany.\" \n\n\n\"Why didn't your firm predict the collapse of communism in East Germany?\" \n\n\n\"We don't Red-bait. Nobody could have seen that coming. If we had told you last \nyear that there would soon be only one Germany, you would have asked for your \nmoney back. Weren't you surprised?\" \n\n\n\"I pay you so that I won't be surprised. How come I didn't hear from you when \nBulgaria went under?\" \n\n\n\"We told you that there is a surcharge for information about events in \nBulgaria. Willard, were we or weren't we right on Poland?\" \n\n\n\"You were as right as Time magazine which was where I first read the story. \nWhat have you been doing about the Soviet Union? \n\n\n\"I have to know now.

Norton: $19.95; 299 \npages.) \n\n\nAt the end of the '70s, when Harvard University launched a drive to \nsubstantially increase its already massive endowment, all the stops were pulled \nout. There was a twisting of alumni arms on a scale never seen before. Among \nthe really high-torque operatives was Henry Rosovsky, dean of the faculty of \narts and sciences and the university's chief academic administrator. \n\n\nAn early arm was that of John L. Loeb, a prominent New York financier and \nphilanthropist. For the occasion, President Derek Bok came along; Loeb treated \nthem to hamburgers at the Four Seasons. It was gastronomic Harvardry -- \nprovident chic, that is, like using a worn Vuitton bag to carry your cheese \nsandwich. In his memoir, \"The University,\" Rosovsky recalls: \n\n\n\"As the conversation gently evolved towards specific dollar amounts, our host \ninquired: 'Are you asking me for $5 million?' I replied: 'Not quite, sir. My \nhope is that you will agree to give $10 million, so that others would be \ninspired to give $5 million.' \n\n\n\"Henry,\" Loeb said, darkening, \"that comes close to chutzpah.\" Abruptly, he \nasked whether Rosovsky knew how to spell the word. (One thing you get in \nexchange for multimillion benefactions is the right to grill a Harvard dean on \nhis spelling.) \n\n\nBut if knowledge is power, then it was time for No. 1 to strut his stuff. \n\"Suddenly, the president of Harvard University snatched the napkin from my \nhands,\" Rosovsky continues, \"and printed CHUTZPAH in large block letters on the \npaper and gave it to Mr. Loeb.\" \n\n\nA few days later, Loeb sent word he was good for about $9 million. \"We had \nestablished that the value of chutzpah is approximately $4 million,\" the writer \nconcludes. \n\n\nIt is witty, urbane, a touch cool, a touch smug, a touch fierce, and it ends \nwith an academic flourish in Prof. Rosovsky's own field: economics. And \nunderneath there is a winning glee in the entire operation and, above all, in \ntelling of it. \n\n\nThese are the marks of Rosovsky's engaging account of 11 years spent shoving \nHarvard uphill. It's hard to do when your shov-ee hasn't the least doubt that \nit already is on top. In general, Rosovsky thinks so too, but he gives us an \naccount of the diplomacy, finagling, and intellectual judo -- you use your \npartner's lunge to keep him pointed the right way -- to patch the holes and \nminimize the slides. \n\n\nRosovsky has dean-like things to say about the advantages for undergraduates of \nuniversity-colleges such as Harvard, with big research and graduate programs, \nas against the small liberal arts college (more stimulation). We hear about \nHarvard's core curriculum -- a means of broadening a student's program by \nreplacing general education courses with a series of highly focused specific \nones. Some of it sounds like a speech or a position paper; some of it is. \n\n\nWhen Rosovsky, like his core curriculum, gets away from generalities and down \nto particulars, the book shines. He gives us a composite of a well-packed \ndean's day. Among its events is the discovery that his plan to save money by \nreducing the painting of classrooms would mean laying off painters; and, under \nunion rules about seniority, those laid-off would be black. Painting will \nproceed as scheduled. \n\n\nEverything is linked to everything else. His financial assistant insists \ntuition must be raised; this will mean anguish and higher outlays for \nscholarships. We get one of the Rosovskyisms that stud the book: \"I know that \nfew decisions have to be made immediately and that it is best not to make them \nin a macho frame of mind.\" \n\n\nAn economics professor comes in to complain that his pay raise is only 1%. \nRosovsky takes pleasure in proving to him that the correct figure is 6%. A \ndelegation of Jewish students brings 3,000 signatures to protest the holding of \ncommencement during a religious holiday. Rosovsky is unimpressed: \"In our \ncommunity, thousands of signatures can be obtained in a few hours for nearly \nanything.\" More to the point, he has obtained in advance rabbinical advice to \nback him up; it helps, he adds, that he is Jewish. \n\n\nHe has to speak harshly to a professor who refuses to meet with his classes, \ncomplaining that his students are \"inauthentic.\" Later, painfully, it turns out \nthat the man has lost his mind and has to be retired on pay. \n\n\nHarvard has no special dispensation in the competition for talent. It has to \nsweat. The chairman of the chemistry department sends over a note from a Nobel \nprize winner in Britain who had been asked to comment on a list of names for a \nvacancy. \"With the reputation you have got for treatment of the branch of \nchemistry that has most rapidly developed over the past 30 years . . . any of \nthe distinguished gentlemen on your short list would be as mad as the \nproverbial March hares to leave their cushy nests, particularly those who have \nbeen spurned by Harvard in the past.\" \n\n\nIt is a reflection of the most important battle Rosovsky fought during his \ntenure: getting fresh blood. There are Harvard departments that resist \nvirtually any possible candidate. The philosophy department, he writes, is so \nhighly rated it suffers \"the classic pathology: the inability to find anyone \nworthy of joining its ranks. It is in imminent danger of becoming a club of old \ngentlemen, more exclusive with every retirement and death. In my imagination, I \npicture the department with only one member: a patriarch holding a gigantic bag \nof black balls.\" \n\n\nAccordingly, Rosovsky sets aside an hour and a bottle of the best sherry to woo \na brilliant young philosopher from a Midwestern university who has managed to \ncrawl out of the black ball sack. There is a high salary, a job for the wife, a \nhousing allowance and a small slush fund. \n\n\nRosovsky has provocative things to say about tenure, about the pleasures and \npains of being a professor, the hard path for the young Ph.D., the peculiar \nstrains, balances and imbalances of power in a university, the envy and \nrivalries that develop. \"Universities and colleges are schools for adults,\" he \nwrites, \"and the requirements of schooling and adulthood can be difficult to \nreconcile.\" \n\n\nIt is appropriate that the book concludes with an exchange of letters with John \nKenneth Galbraith. (The latter responds to Rosovsky's all-points instruction \nwarning against romances between faculty and graduate and undergraduate \nstudents. He had committed such a fault decades ago, Galbraith confesses, and \nwas still happily married to her; what did the dean advise? Discretion, the \ndean replies.) \n\n\nRosovsky, who held his job longer than anyone since World War II -- he lets us \nknow this -- before deciding to return to teaching, much resembles Galbraith in \nhis style, graceful and with a deadly understatement. \n\n\nFriday: Elaine Kendall reviews \"Fling and Other Stories\" by John Hersey."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0198", "docId": "180014", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "View; Part E; Page 5; Column 3; View Desk", "length": "1035", "headline": "MAGAZINES: BEACH CULTURE: SALTY VISION OF MEANING OF LIFE", "byline": "By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, Beach Culture will address the human condition, surfer-style.", "text": "Just because surfers have spawned a billion-dollar fashion industry, do we need \nto listen to their ruminations on the meaning of life? \n\n\nA new publication from the folks at Surfer Magazine thinks so. \n\n\nBeach Culture -- Real Life in the Coastal Zone hit the stands this month with a \nnote from publisher Steve Pezman declaring: \"Unabashedly hedonistic and \nnarcissistic, the beach culture is now truly a significant marketplace of the \nmodern human condition.\" \n\n\nBy the time a subculture becomes self-reflective, it's a good bet that the sea \ngulls of mainstream merchandising are already nipping at its leathery flesh. In \nfact, the fashion industry has been scavenging ideas from the beach culture for \ndecades. Now the fashion industry has absorbed everything that defined beach \nculture. \n\n\nThe line between the realities of the surfer-skateboarder-snowboarder \nsubculture and marketing mythology washed away long ago. But Beach Culture \nisn't about to back away from the pose of macho individualism that sells \nneoprene bikinis in Des Moines. \n\n\nIntent on establishing the superiority of the surfer world view, \nEditor-in-Chief Paul Holmes writes that \"testing limits (through surfing or \nskateboarding or playing volleyball) builds character, enhances the sense of \nindividualism in a land of lemmings.\" \n\n\nAnd then: \"What does George Bush know about staring into the face of a 20-foot, \nfish-killing, close-out set? \n\n\n\"Nothing,\" he answers. \"And that's his problem.\" \n\n\nOf course, the most compliant conformists are those under peer pressure to be \ndifferent, and surfers have always been dragged around by fashion currents -- \neven, perhaps, the one-tenth of 1% or so who have actually surfed 20-foot \nwaves. \n\n\nAnyway, readers should know better than to take the highbrow beach blather \nseriously. Sand has never been particularly fertile turf for the rigorous \nanalysis of society. \n\n\nThe beach is, however, a great place to forget modern reality and enjoy life. \nAnd Beach Culture makes up for its inability to articulate a post-adolescent \nworld view with lots of blazing color and visual attitude that says it all. \n\n\nThat the editorial content and advertising are a bit blurred together is part \nof the gestalt, Dude. \n\n\nThe best thing in this premiere issue of this \"seasonal bimonthly\" (next one \nhits the stands in April) is a well-reproduced collection of art by artists who \nsurf. Their mercifully brief commentary demonstrates that the beach life can be \ninspiring. \n\n\nSo.

So far, Buzz \nhas hired George Christy, who also writes for the Hollywood Reporter, to do a \ncolumn called \"Restaurants and Such.\" \n\n\nReal estate broker Cheryl Crane, best known as Lana Turner's daughter, will \nwrite a column called \"Gimme Shelter,\" about real estate and \"the way people \nlive in Los Angeles and why.\" \n\n\nOther columnists named by Mayer include Mary Gwynn, who will contribute a \nparenting column titled \"Oh Baby,\" and novelist Harlin Ellison, who will write \na column titled \"The Valley,\"which he promises will \"boil the blood, open the \neyes and sting the soul.\" \n\n\n\n\nDefenders Make Pitch for Desert Protection \n\n\nFor an unabashedly biased look at the controversial California Desert \nProtection Act, pick up a copy of the January/February Defenders magazine, \nwhich is published bimonthly by the Washington, D.C.-based organization \nDefenders of Wildlife. \n\n\nThe two main articles in this special issue -- Peter Steinhart's \"Desert Hope, \nDesert Folly\" and Elena Jarvis' \"Rambo's Racers\" -- reveal as much love for \noff-road vehicle enthusiasts and other desert despoilers as a road runner has \nfor a rattler. \n\n\nThe pictures in this issue speak even more forcefully than the well-crafted \nwords.

I am an \nexperienced collector, but I do not understand this term. Would you explain it? \n-- W.C.P. \n\n\nAnswer: Demonetization is the official governmental fiscal deprivation of the \nstandard value of a medium of exchange. In common language, that means that \nmoney (or stamps) are no longer worth the face value that they had when issued. \n\n\nShaky economies in some countries often lead to debasing or revaluing of the \npaper money. For instance, rampant inflation may make money practically \nworthless. So the government announces that 1,000 of its currency, say pesos, \nwill henceforth be known as 1 \"New Peso\" and that, after a certain date, all \nthe old currency that hasn't been exchanged for new money will no longer be \nhonored. \n\n\nIn the United States in the last century, our Post Office Department \ndemonetized pre-Civil War stamps of the 1851 to 1860 designs so stamps then in \nthe hands of Confederate postmasters couldn't be used in some way to disrupt \nthe commerce of the Union states. Perhaps Southern spies might have infiltrated \nbusiness houses in the North and sold them U.S. stamps at a discount (stamps \nthat were sitting in Confederate post offices after secession), thereby \ndepriving the Federal postal service of revenue. The beautifully engraved and \nquite valuable 1847 first issues (5-cent Franklin and 10-cent Washington, our \nfirst \"General Issue\" adhesive stamps) were similarly declared invalid for \npostage as of July 1, 1851, when the 1851 to 1860 definitive series began. It \nis still against the law to use a lot of pre-Civil War U.S. stamps for mailing \nletters, but for large-margined pristine specimens, if any can be found in \n1990, the philatelic and market value is astronomical. \n\n\nQ: As an insider in the stamp market, you must make a lot of money from stamp \ndeals. Is it hard to establish the contacts that result in lucrative stamp \ninvestments? -- D.E. \n\n\nA: I break even on my stamp \"deals.\" Some stamps I sell at a small profit, \nothers I sell at a loss. I am not a stamp dealer, so I don't have to buy at \nrock-bottom prices and sell at comfortable profits to make a living from \nstamps. I teach and write for money. \n\n\nIf it were that easy to get rich, we would all be millionaires. I know a lot \nabout stamps after studying them and the stamp hobby/business for 30 years. But \nthat doesn't enable me to see into the future, with all its unpredictables. \n\n\nSome people study the horses for a lifetime and still can't win consistently at \nthe race track. Stock brokers know a lot about stocks, but they have to cater \nto customers at moderate buying/selling commissions because nobody knows for \nsure which stocks will double in price this year. In fact, \"insiders\" with \nextensive knowledge about a tradable commodity are the first to admit that it \nis tough to predict precisely anything in that business. \n\n\nQ: I have a few plate blocks of the 80-cent Hawaiian air mail from the 1950s. \nAre these worth something? -- R.W.E. \n\n\nA: About $20 each for an unhinged plate number margin block-of-four. Issued \nMarch 26, 1952, this reddish-violet, 80-cent U.S. air mail (Scott No. C46) was, \naccording to some stories, produced specifically for paying the cost of sending \norchids between Hawaii (which wasn't yet a state) and the U.S. mainland, \nbecause no normal air-mail rate required an 80-cent stamp then. The pretty \nstamp is ever-so-slowly increasing in value as the years go by. \n\n\nQ: Is membership in national stamp societies expensive? And what are the \nbenefits? -- P.R. \n\n\nA: For $21 (an admission fee of $3 plus annual dues of $18), you can join the \nlargest philatelic society in the United States: American Philatelic Society, \nP.O. Box 8000, State College, Pa. 16803. Bank and credit references as well as \ntwo character references must be given on the application forms (send a \nstamped, self-addressed business-size envelope to the above address). Benefits \ninclude an impressive, 96-page monthly journal; low-cost stamp insurance; sales \ncircuits; discounts on expertizing (guarantee) certificates, and news on \nupcoming stamp exhibitions and auctions. Probably 95% of the serious \nphilatelists in the country are members of the APS. My membership dates from \n1976, and I've found the membership fees have more than paid for themselves \nmany times over. \n\n\nQ: I have some 19th-Century Egyptian stamps showing the Sphinx and a Pyramid. \nAre these rare? -- F.G. \n\n\nA: From 1867 until the early 20th Century, the \"workhorse\" stamp issues of \nEgypt were the Sphinx and Pyramid varieties. They range from a few cents each \nto hundreds of dollars apiece in current market value. Many varieties exist, \nsuch as different watermarks, thin and thick papers, perforation gauge changes \nand the like. Show your stamps to a dealer for a professional evaluation. \n\n\nQ: Is there a stamp club in the Fairfax-Wilshire area? I used to go to a club a \nlong time ago and would like to get involved in stamp collecting again. -- R.W. \n\n\nA: Try the Collectors Club of Hollywood, which meets at the California Federal \nSavings & Loan Assn., 3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue, on the second Tuesday \nof each month at 8 p.m., according to my latest information from them. \n\n\nQ: What do you recommend as a sound stamp investment for the 1990s? I've been \nworking on U.S. air mails and an album of Canadian plate blocks from 1930 to \ndate. -- T.B. \n\n\nA: Ah, the future! Sometimes you have to wonder whether it is good or bad that \nwe can't see the future with complete clarity. If differences of opinion make a \nhorse race, then similar varying viewpoints make stamp investment an \ninteresting speculation. \n\n\nMy advice is to stick with the so-called \"blue-chip\" stamps, the ones with an \nestablished track record for steady price appreciation over the years. Early \nU.S. mint and used in extremely fine condition, costing more than $25 per \nstamp; complete sets of British Colonies; choice Western European definitives \nand souvenir sheets from before World War II; nice Asian covers, and \n19th-Century classics in multiples (more than one stamp in a \"piece\") or with \nunusually wide, well-balanced margins around the designs -- these are stamps \nthat have been in demand and probably will always have buyers as long as there \nare philatelists in the world."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0200", "docId": "180022", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "View; Part E; Page 11; Column 1; View Desk", "length": "267", "headline": "CHARITY SCORECARD: A THANK YOU FOR A PACEMAKER", "byline": "By BEA MAXWELL", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, Cancer benefit: Actress Tippi Hedren, chatting with Marty Golden, \npresident of Concern Foundation for Cancer Research, was among celebrities \ndonating their own art to Robert J.

Whenever \nmoody San Francisco fog failed to appear, special effects technicians brought \nout fans and smoke canisters. One day, they created such a thick fog outside \nHackman's law office, a fire truck rushed to the scene, mistaking the billowing \nclouds for smoke. \n\n\nApted, who started his career making documentaries, also happened to have a law \ndegree from Oxford. He insisted that this film be accurate. During the last 10 \nyears, the bi-continental director has made his mark with such films as \"Coal \nMiner's Daughter,\" \"Gorky Park\" and \"Gorillas in the Mist.\" \n\n\nIn \"Class Action,\" he moves into an environment of ambition and high money \nstakes, where lawyers lie and conceal evidence to defend a corporation. \"It's a \njunk-bond culture creating a junk society,\" Apted said. \"A chilling aspect of \nlife in America is that acquiring wealth and paying less taxes are more \nimportant than dealing with the nightmare of growing poverty and cities falling \nto pieces.\" \n\n\nHackman, who has made more films in the last six years than any other American \nactor, said he can't remember how many lawyers he's played, but called this one \nhis meatiest yet. \"There are a lot of highly emotional, gut-wrenching scenes,\" \nhe said. \"I don't have to shoot anybody or ride in fast cars and best of all, \nMichael keeps the set calm, listens to what I have to say. He's very civilized, \ngreat to work with.\" \n\n\nApted urged Hackman and Mastrantonio to watch Tony Serra deliver a 2 1/2-hour \nopening argument of a murder case. \"My character,\" said Hackman, \"is a similar \nkind of people's advocate -- very theatrical, powerful, impressive.\" \nIronically, Hackman played a scene for Francis Coppola's 1973 \"The \nConversation\" in Serra's law office. Like both Serra and his film character, \nHackman is a liberal who proudly recalled making Nixon's notorious \"Enemies \nList\" because of his work for George McGovern. During filming he made two \npublic service TV spots for charity and spent his 59th birthday teaching acting \nto kids in a San Francisco high school. \n\n\n\"It's rare to see a father-daughter relationship explored on film,\" said \nHackman, who brought his two grown daughters and son to watch his tense \ncourtroom scenes with Mastrantonio. \"A conservative daughter raised by a very \nliberal father -- this is very fertile territory.\" \n\n\nHackman talks with obvious wariness to reporters, but he loosens up when \ntalking about his three stunt planes; he's been doing aerobatics as a hobby for \n12 years. \"I just bought an Eagle, a two-seater plane. I wish I could fly more, \nbut I can't when I'm in a picture because of insurance. You can't be a weekend \nacrobatic pilot . . . otherwise you will be an ex-acrobatic pilot.\" \n\n\nAfter he finishes his next film, \"Dinosaurs,\" with Mikhail Baryshnikov in \nBerlin, Hackman said he's going to take a break and relax in his planes and in \nthe race cars he often drives in celebrity events. On his days off here, he has \nbeen house-hunting. \"I love it here,\" said Hackman. Since his 30-year marriage \nended in 1986, he's been sharing his Santa Fe adobe with 29-year-old Betsy \nArakawa, whom he met while she was working at a fitness center. \n\n\nGreg Goosen, Hackman's stand-in for his last nine movies, calls him \"Everyman, \na working man's actor.\" It's a term many critics have applied to him, as well, \nand Hackman winces when it's brought up. \"I don't like being called Everyman -- \nthat sounds like I'm not acting, that I'm not putting thought into my \nperformance. It's hard work making the character look easy.\" \n\n\nIt was an uneasy, long road to the screen for Hackman. A poor kid from \nDanville, Ill., his father abruptly left home when he was 13. The troubled \nadolescent lied about his age and joined the Marines at 16. During his five \nyears in Asia, a stint as an Armed Forces radio announcer hooked him on acting. \n\n\nBut it took years to make it to the screen. For the next decade he drifted \naround the United States working as a truck driver, soda jerk, doorman, shoe \nsalesman, furniture salesman. He finally made it to the Pasadena Playhouse, \nonly to find that he and \"beatnik\" pal Dustin Hoffman were considered least \nlikely to succeed. \n\n\nHe hitchhiked to New York, where he did menial jobs and talked his way into \nsummer stock and bit parts for another decade. In 1967, Hackman finally earned \nenough money to support his wife and three kids, after Warren Beatty cast him \nas his older brother in \"Bonnie and Clyde.\" His Academy Award nomination as \nBest Supporting Actor proved Pasadena Playhouse wrong. \n\n\nBut it was his landmark performance in \"The French Connection\" that showed he \nwas more than a character actor. As Popeye Doyle, the vulgar New York police \ndetective, Hackman won the Oscar as Best Actor in 1971. Despite his new fame, \nan insecure Hackman did what he called \"the poor-boy thing,\" working non-stop, \nmaking some forgettable films, buying and selling real estate, cars and planes. \n\n\nSuffering burn-out, Hackman quit acting in 1978 after \"Superman,\" a time he \nremembers as \"probably a mid-life crisis\" -- he took to the cockpit, raced \ncars, and painted impressionist oils. He returned to acting two years later, \ndiscovering \"there wasn't much else I was suited for.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0202", "docId": "180024", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Calendar; Part F; Page 1; Column 5; Entertainment Desk", "length": "863", "headline": "DANCE REVIEW;", "byline": "By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC/DANCE CRITIC", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, The final bows at the American Ballet Theatre Gala, as presented Tuesday \nin San Francisco. FRED MERTZ / Los Angeles Times", "text": "The massive party took place last month at the Metropolitan Opera House in New \nYork when American Ballet Theatre celebrated its 50th birthday. No one \npretended that the event was coherent, but a lot of push-button sentimentalists \nenjoyed the glitzy rituals. \n\n\nThis, after all, was a very big socio-aesthetic deal. A good seat cost $1,200. \nThe on-stage guest list included such bona fide ballerinas as Alicia Alonso \n(dancing in the face of dotage), Carla Fracci, Gelsey Kirkland and Natalia \nMakarova. Agnes de Mille contributed a few testy words. Twyla Tharp made a \nsurprise appearance shoving a delirious danseur out of her epochal \"Push.\" \n\n\nOnly one beloved body was conspicuously missing. It belonged to Mikhail \nBaryshnikov, who had abandoned his company in the wake of a major managerial \nimbroglio. \n\n\nWhether his self-imposed absence made the collective heart grow fonder became a \nmoot point. Fernando Bujones, a rival matinee idol, provided compensation of \nsorts, returning to the fold from which he had been ousted. Moreover, one could \nfind distraction in home movies, production numbers, nostalgia indulgences and \norgies of self-congratulation. \n\n\nHad all gone as planned, Los Angeles would have caught up with some \nmanifestation of the anniversary festivities this summer. The projected ABT \nengagement at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion was canceled, however, when the \nMusic Center failed to reconcile an unfortunate booking dispute with the \ncompany. \n\n\nErgo, the version of the historic event mustered Tuesday night at the War \nMemorial Opera House provided California with its only exposure to the great \nballetic bash. As the ever-perverse fates would have it, alas, this Gala didn't \nturn out to be particularly gala. \n\n\nSan Francisco got the economy-size road-show version. The top ticket fetched a \npaltry $250. The only live guest in sight was Makarova, who, having finally \nhung up her toe shoes, rambled through some charming, ultra-affectionate \nanecdotes. Not incidentally, Bujones had been promised by Jane Hermann, the new \nexecutive director, but he didn't show. \n\n\nEach half of the three-hour would-be extravaganza began with a razzle-dazzle \noverture energetically conducted by Jack Everly. Then came tantalizing -- and \nfrustrating -- collages of film clips. Some were ancient and some recent, some \nrare and some commonplace. \n\n\nThe often fuzzy, nearly subliminal images on the screen flitted forward and \nbackward in time, reducing significant art to stream-of-consciousness snippets. \nThe musical pastiches on the sound track sometimes forced the protagonists to \ndance to the wrong tune. The uncredited, hyperbolic narration, voiced-over by \nPeter Donat, proved notable neither for good grammar nor for good taste. \n\n\nWhen it came to show time, the company mustered a little bit of this, and a \ntiny bit of that. The dancers plucked highlights from highlights, strung \ntogether in willy-nilly chaos. Place the accent on nilly. \n\n\nThe viewer was allowed no sense of context. No continuity. No edification. No \nsubstance. \n\n\nTurning 50, American Ballet Theatre turned to a slick collection of variety \nacts. The tone was flashy, the pace fast, fast, fast. Here was another fancy \ninstallment in the annals of balletic vaudeville, conceived and directed by \nMichael Smuin. \n\n\nFinding specific things to savor in the hippety-hop jumble seemed akin to \npicking the peanuts out of a box of Cracker Jack. One's hands got sticky, yet \nthe rewards -- beyond indigestion -- remained small. \n\n\nThe company performed chunklets of 25 repertory items frantically, and often \nwell. Although Baryshnikov's dancers may not command instantly compelling \npersonalities, they are strong technicians and careful stylists. \n\n\nAmanda McKerrow, sympathetically supported by Kevin McKenzie, floated \nexquisitely through a moment from Antony Tudor's \"The Leaves Are Fading.\" \nAlessandra Ferri, sensitively partnered by John Gardner, arched poignantly amid \nthe \"Lindenduft\" of Eliot Feld's \"At Midnight,\" and ignored a chronically \noff-pitch mezzo-soprano in the process. Susan Jaffe, nobly seconded by Ricardo \nBustamante, exuded lyric refinement as the White Swan. \n\n\nJohan Renvall glittered as the Bronze Idol of \"La Bayadere.\" Julio Bocca \ngobbled space ferociously as Solor, and Cynthia Harvey breathed refinement as \nhis Gamzatti. Martine van Hamel defined Petipa grandeur as Raymonda. Cynthia \nGregory, the obvious audience favorite, sustained the poetic balances of the \nRose Adagio even better in the flesh than she had on the screen. \n\n\nNo one, unfortunately, had a chance to establish a serious interpretive \nstatement. There was no time to set, much less develop, a specific mood. \nEverything and everyone passed in a pretty blink. \n\n\nThe choreography of \"La Sylphide\" melted into \"Giselle,\" which blurred into \n\"The Sleeping Beauty.\" Tudor got scrambled, Baryshnikov got slighted, and, \ninexplicably, Clark Tippet got snubbed. \n\n\nAt the end, Smuin & Co. trivialized Balanchine's \"Theme and Variations,\" \ntransforming the elegant finale into a motley costume parade. This act of \nviolence heralded the arrival of tinsel streamers, balloons and curtain calls \nfor the anonymous administrators. \n\n\nThe applause wasn't deafening."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0203", "docId": "180031", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Calendar; Part F; Page 2; Column 1; Entertainment Desk", "length": "68", "headline": "MORNING REPORT: TV & VIDEO", "byline": "By BETH KLEID, Arts and entertainment reports from The Times, national and \ninternational news services and the nation's press.", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "Dr. Ruth in Love: Dr. Ruth Westheimer will reportedly star in a half-hour ABC \ncomedy series called \"Dr. Ruth's House.\" The sex therapist will play Dr. Ruth \nEngelhof, who runs an off-campus rooming house near Albert University in \nConnecticut and who is romantically involved with the dean.

A wave of intelligence and energy \nsplashed across town; with such good news, the death of Waiver wouldn't mean \nmuch. \n\n\nA year later, and a wave of the sillies has come down upon us. Even a usually \nreliable group like L.A. Theatre Unit, which has produced such work as \n\"Andrea's Got Two Boyfriends\" and \"The White Death,\" has come up with some \nsilly antics posing as a play, \"Tiger Treadwell Takes Tinseltown.\" \n\n\nTo be sure, Steve Itkin's production at the new but user-unfriendly Ventura \nCourt Theatre certainly doesn't serve John Susman's Hollywood spoof very well. \nThe only way to save Susman's string of ludicrous comic scenes and plot points \nis to play it over the top -- but with style. Itkin's style is like a badly \ndrawn cartoon, with the ham-fisted support of David Andrade's slide projections \nand Marc I. Rosenthal's lights. \n\n\nWe won't reveal Susman's narrative trick that begins and ends the Tinseltown \nconquest of Tiger (Karl Wiedergott), but it plays on Edward G. Robinson prison \nmovies and \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Tiger's rapid rise to the top -- imagine a rock \n'n' roll Sammy Glick, fond of dining at Morton's -- involves an agent who plays \ntennis with his phone headset on (David Wells), an ex-hooker (Laura Summer) and \ntwo Arab money men (Daniel Mahar and Charles Dayton). \n\n\nIn the early stages, Susman's ear isn't so out of whack that we can't accept \nhis show-biz cliches. And for admirers of Howard Korder's brilliant comic \nthriller of movie- and dream-making ambition, \"Search and Destroy,\" Susman's \n\"Tiger\" has some pleasing echoes. \n\n\nIt all goes downhill frighteningly fast. Tiger wants to make a teen-age-alien \nlove story. Dayton's Amir loves it, but sees it as a sailing picture (he has \nthis thing for boats). Yet the financing Arab country wants the flick shot \nentirely within its borders. Solution: Build a huge lake in the desert. \n\n\nSomeone should have stopped things right there, when this comedy goes over the \nside into pure dumb nonsense. More business with slave-labor on location, and \ndistribution deals, and Cannes yacht parties, and so on, fill out the rest of \nthe play. But that's all it is: filler. Susman's people are vacuously \nlow-calorie. \n\n\nAnother cast -- perhaps the Actors' Gang -- might be able to turn this into a \nbold cartoon. But only Wells has enough of a quirky personal touch to turn his \ncharacter into more than a familiar stereotype. Tiger, at least, isn't a \nstereotype, but Wiedergott brings nothing original to a part wide open to a \ncreative actor's impulses. \n\n\n At 12417 Ventura Court, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., until March 25. \nTickets: $12-$14; (213) 466-1767."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0208", "docId": "180042", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Calendar; Part F; Page 9; Column 1; Entertainment Desk", "length": "369", "headline": "MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;", "byline": "By CHRIS PASLES", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "From mere nothings to a dance of metaphoric implication, Tandy Beal and Company \ntriumphed in a seven-part program Tuesday at the State Playhouse at Cal State \nL.A., second in a new dance series at the university. \n\n\nIn her lightweight solo \"Figure of Speech,\" the Santa Cruz-based Beal made \nseveral not-so-false starts, took audience members into her confidence and \nchallenged them to consider various ways of continuing the work, and ultimately \nmade a dance about making a dance. Modest but engaging. \n\n\nAt the other end of the scale was her \"Dust to Dust\" (music by Jon Scoville), \nin which five dancers evoked universal games and struggles, became icons of \nEastern religions, metamorphosed into everyday figures; then begin the cycle \nanew, only to vanish into luminous pillars of sand streaming down from the top \nof the stage. \n\n\nBefore that stunning ending, Beal managed another theatrical coup: two screens \nupon which projected slides of the dancers were slowly peeled open, allowing \nthe images to pass through to a scrim at the back of the stage, while, one by \none, the living figures moved through seams in the screen onto the stage. \n\n\nThe multiplicity of images, the juxtapositions of fixed art and living humanity \nsuggested the reciprocal processes by which life and art are transformed and \ninformed by one another. \n\n\nBeal's four-part solo \"Everything Is True but Desire\" (substituted, because of \ntechnical problems, for \"Mysterious Barricades\") traced a woman's excursions \ninto experience -- the rebuffs she encounters, her stylized rituals of defense \nand her final ambiguous triumphs. \n\n\n\"Little Kings,\" a satirical group piece, mocked pretentions and power plays and \nended with the six puffed-up egos being deflated like plums dried into prunes. \n\n\nFour familiar works completed the program: \"Creation du Monde,\" Beal's genial \ncompany vignette, winding back from a sophisticated ballroom scene to an \nanimal-romp Garden of Eden; \"Neither Darkness nor Science,\" a playful, eerie \nshadow duet for Beal and Ellen Sevy, and two excerpts from \"The Time Falling \nBodies Take to Light\" -- a men's gymnastic duet (danced strongly by Erik Stern \nand Ken Williams) and Beal's superb weightless, feathery solo.

Cohen provided some humorous verbal annotation, but largely let \nthe music deliver its own message through pointed program juxtapositions. \n\n\nThe entire second half of the agenda matched songs from the Sephardic oral \ntradition with some of the Cantigas de Sancta Maria collected by Alfonso el \nSabio in the 13th Century. \n\n\nThe program began similarly, with sets that included a performance alternating \nthe Latin and Hebrew versions of the same Psalm tone.

FESTIVAL;", "byline": "By SHAUNA SNOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER", "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "A week after the Los Angeles Festival made its first announcement of programing \nfor the Sept. 1-17 arts festival, many of the more than 600 artists and \nperforming groups who had applied but were not included are undecided as to \nwhether to take part in the connected Open Festival, which offers no financial \nsubsidies for artists. \n\n\nIn making such decisions, artists contacted this week said that they faced \nseveral obstacles, including lack of funding, not enough time to find venues, a \nlack of information from festival planners and inability to compete with \ncurated events for audiences once the festival rolls around next fall. Some \nsaid that they had already decided not to participate. \n\n\n\"I had applied for the L.A. Festival and hoped to be included, but I don't \nthink I will do the Open Festival at all,\" said Francisco Martinez, whose \n10-member Francisco Martinez Dance Theater is in residence at East Los Angeles' \nPlaza de la Raza. \"I don't think I would be able to gather any kind of audience \nbecause there will already be so much going on in terms of dance.\" \n\n\nDespite such obstacles, however, Open Festival coordinator Aaron Paley, who \nalso ran the Open Festival's precursor, the 1987 Fringe Festival, said that he \nexpects about 500 artists and groups totaling about 10,000 individuals to \nparticipate (about the same number involved in 1987, when 450 events were \nproduced). Any and all artists are welcome, but all will have to produce their \nevents themselves. Paley hopes, however, that the Open Festival's guidance may \nmake the difference for artists who wouldn't be able to do so otherwise. \n\n\n\"Our responsibility is to ease those burdens of production as much as we can,\" \nsaid Paley, adding that the Open Festival's $260,000 budget will be used to \npromote and provide publicity for all Open Festival activities and to hold \nworkshops dealing with production aspects such as ticketing and finding a \nvenue. \n\n\nThe Open Festival is also producing a how-to manual, \"Doing it Right in L.A.: \nSelf-Producing for the Performing Artist,\" and a list of about 900 venues in \nLos Angeles County ranging from churches and community centers to traditional \ntheaters and museums. \n\n\nIn addition, L.A. Festival Executive Director Judith Luther has said that some \nOpen Festival programs may be selected to appear on the same stages as curated \nprograms, and thus would receive free use of the stage and some technical \nsupport. Paley said that details for such arrangements were still up in the \nair, however, because matters such as who would insure those Open Festival \nartists had not been determined. But, Paley added, a main activity of the Open \nFestival staff is networking with venues throughout the city to find spaces in \nwhich artists can present their works for reduced costs. \n\n\nWith only a little more than six months to go, most artists contacted had not \nyet decided whether to be part of the Open Festival. \n\n\nCulver City-based contemporary composer Paul Des Marais is in the position of \nmany artists contacted this week. He had hoped to present his \"Two Fables,\" a \nmoveable theater piece featuring a narrator and three musicians, in the curated \nportion of the festival. He is interested in the Open Festival, but doesn't \nknow much about it. \n\n\n\"I received a letter that was so complicated and baroque that I didn't quite \nknow what it meant, but I think it was a rejection notice (from the L.A. \nFestival),\" he said. \"I'm still interested in the Open Festival, but I don't \nquite know how to move from here. I thought I would get a little more \ninformation and recommendations (from Festival organizers) on what to do.\" \n\n\nTo that end, Paley said he and his staff (which includes five paid people and \nsix interns) produce a monthly newsletter that is sent out to more than 700 \nartists who have expressed interest in the Open Festival. In addition, they \nspeak in depth with more than two dozen artists a day, both by phone and in \nperson. And an average of 15 additional \"intent to participate forms\" arrive \neach day. \n\n\nOf those already familiar with the concept of the Open Festival, many said \ntheir participation is contingent on receiving funding from sources such as the \ncity's Cultural Affairs Department. \n\n\n\"It's going to be at least $7,000 for me to produce my piece (for a weekend \nrun) and I don't think I can do it if I don't get the funding,\" said \ndancer/choreographer Donna Sternberg, who has applied for a $10,000 grant \nthrough the Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts and hopes to collaborate with a \ncomposer, singer and other dancers. \n\n\nAlso waiting to hear about Cultural Affairs grants is Santa Monica-based \nperformance artist Sharon Kagan, who is working on a large-scale piece \ninvolving about 25 performers, called \"As I Recall.\" \n\n\n\"If I can get the funding in time, I would like to do it,\" Kagan said, noting \nit would cost about $15,000 to produce the piece. \"But right now I'm really up \nin the air.\" \n\n\nAccording to Al Nodal, general manager of the Cultural Affairs Department, Open \nFestival projects will be given some priority when the more than $2 million in \ngrants is awarded July 1, but they will not take precedence over other \npriorities, including artists with special needs, such as minorities and the \nhandicapped. \n\n\n\"The Open Festival is one of many (priorities),\" said Nodal, noting that \nCultural Affairs had already given grants of $150,000 to the L.A. Festival and \n$10,000 to the Open Festival. \"We want to support the Open Festival and we've \nencouraged people to apply, but we can't limit all our funding to things going \nto the Open Festival. . . . We have not set a specific amount aside (for the \nOpen Festival).\" \n\n\nFunding is not the artists' only concern, however. Some worry that the time is \ntoo short to prepare works for the festival. Such is the case with \nwriter/director Teresa Chavez, who has spent the past year working on her \ntheater piece \"L.A. Real,\" but still doesn't know if it will be ready by \nSeptember. \n\n\n\"If I can get the funds for the work, then I'm considering being in the Open \nFestival,\" said Chavez, part of the collaborative theater group About \nProductions. \"If it comes together by then, then great, but I'm not going to \nkill myself to get it ready in time for the festival.\" \n\n\nBut while she said there is about a 50% chance that her piece, focusing on \nMestizo history in Los Angeles, will be included in the Open Festival, Chavez \nadded, \"I don't really think I have time to find a venue -- unless something \njust pops up in the air -- because venues get booked up.\" \n\n\nIn addition, she said, \"I'm not sure if it's worth being attached to the \nfestival. Being in the Fringe Festival in 1987 did not attract a different or \nbetter audience. So unless you're in the larger (L.A.) festival, I'm not sure \nwhat kind of an audience you can get (in the Open Festival).\" \n\n\nTaking a different view is performance/conceptual artist Elisha Shapiro. Like \neverybody else, he had hoped for funding from the Los Angeles Festival. But he \nsaid that lack of funding wouldn't stop him from producing his \"Nihilism Expo \n90\" during the Open Festival. \n\n\n\"We'll do it one way or another; I've done things on no money before,\" said \nShapiro, who said his \"world's fair\" will include interactive installations by \nartists including Jeffrey Vallance and Michael McMillan and performance pieces \nby artists such as Linda Albertano \n\n\nAlso set on being in the Open Festival is Burbank-based performance artist \nDeborah Marsh, who didn't find out about the L.A. Festival until it was too \nlate to apply, but decided about a month ago to be in the Open Festival. \n\n\n\"The idea of the (Open) Festival goes back to the grass root arts, when art was \nperformed just for the love of the craft. So much of the art now is commercial, \nbut here are a bunch of artists saying, 'Hey, I love my craft. I love my art.' \nThat's what makes me want to be in this festival -- my love for my art.\" \n\n\nMarsh is now looking for a venue in which she can produce her one-woman show, \n\"The Final Mission of Mother Jones,\" which she has been touring since 1986. She \nsays she may not have time left to find a traditional house, however. \n\n\n\"It might be a little tight,\" said Marsh. \"But if I can't get into a theater, I \nmight end up doing it at one of the community centers or libraries, just to put \nit on for the festival.\" \n\n\nSome of those who have decided to join the Open Festival had already planned to \npresent works independently, so foresee no problems with their participation. \n\n\n\"I don't know if our work fits in with the standard 'festival' work, but we \nwant to be under the umbrella of the thing,\" said Lenore Carlson, who is \nworking with director Lisa James in developing \"Palladium is Moving,\" a theater \npiece that Carlson plans to open in the Spring. \n\n\n\"We'll be open long before the festival, but if we close down for any reason in \nthe summer, we want to reopen in September. We just want to be a part of it,\" \nsaid Carlson. \n\n\nStill another view was that of dancer/choreographer Naomi Goldberg, who \nparticipated in the Fringe Festival but has decided not to present work this \ntime around. \n\n\n\"At this point, really, I'd just like to have the time to go and see stuff \nduring that time. The stuff they're bringing is wonderful, and I really want to \nsee it, but when you're involved in a production, that's really hard. So I \nthink this time it might be good just to be a nice attendee.\" \n\n\nSaid Open Festival coordinator Paley: \"Not everybody has to be in the festival. \nIt's important that people consider the context, and the factor that there will \nbe a lot of competition for audiences. \n\n\n\"But we're helping people look at ways of cutting costs so they can be in the \nfestival. Ways like being a better producer, sharing costs, finding venues at \nless cost, and maybe even scaling down expectations. These things are just as \nimportant as getting grants.\" \n\n\nHowever, noted Paley: \"People have to get in gear. There is definitely a \ncritical time frame here.\" \n\n\nThe deadline to register for the Open Festival is the end of May, and Paley \nsaid he hopes to compile a final list of events by July. He urges those \ninterested in information about the Open Festival or who need help finding a \nvenue to call his office at (213) 315-9444."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0211", "docId": "180131", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition", "section": "Sports; Part C; Page 13; Column 1", "length": "4447", "headline": "CITY SECTION BASEBALL PREVIEWS", "byline": null, "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, Pat Treend of El Camino Real played last season on the team that won the \nAmerican Legion championship.

The band included City \nMVP Gino Tagliaferri, All-Valley infielder Mike Murray and three-year starter \nPat DeBoer. Yet, even with those standouts in the lineup, All-City junior \nGarret Anderson batted cleanup -- and did he mop up statistically. Anderson, \nwho bats left-handed and plays in the outfield, hit .362 with five home runs \nand 31 runs batted in. He led area juniors in RBIs in City play. Anderson is \nnot the lone threat, however. Catcher Lazaro Campos, who hit .367, is back for \nhis third season of varsity play and will bat cleanup behind Anderson. Troy \nBourne, a reserve last year, will start at first. James Bernas, an all-league \nmember of the junior varsity, will start at second. Either Billy Ramirez or \nRich Trujillo will fill Tagliaferri's slot at short. Palmer Drain, used as a \ndesignated-hitter last year, starts at third. Ben Guzman, Jason Rosen, Mitchell \nDrain and Birmingham transfer Jack Moussa (.266, nine RBIs) are in a fight for \nthe remaining outfield berths. The pitching corps has been through it all \nbefore. Left-hander Denny Sharp (7-2, 3.75 earned-run average, 108 strikeouts \nin 84 innings) might possess the best curveball in the area. \n\n\nJunior right-hander Cody Beaumaster (4-1, 2.13 ERA) is the No. 2 starter. \nHowever, Sharp (67 walks) and Beaumaster (15 walks in 19 2/3 innings) will need \nbetter control if the Golden Cougars want to make it two titles in a row. \n\n\nOUTLOOK: \"Last year at this time pitching was our big question mark,\" Alvarado \nsaid. \"Now that seems to be one of our strengths.\" Last year's strength was the \ninfield. That also has changed. \"It's one of the strongest outfield teams I've \never been associated with,\" Alvarado said. \"As long as we can catch it and \nthrow it, we'll be in good shape.\" \n\n\nSan Fernando \n\n\nCOACH: Steve Marden, 14th year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 16-7-1; 2nd in league at 10-5-1 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: If San Fernando makes a run at Kennedy for the league title, \nit will be behind the strength of its pitching staff. John Najar, a utility \nplayer last season as a junior, has been converted into a pitcher and Marden is \npleased with what he sees. \"He could be the most dominant pitcher I've seen all \nwinter,\" Marden said. Hector De La Cruz, a three-year letterman, returns for \nhis senior year. De La Cruz (6-1, 3.42 ERA, 58 strikeouts in 58 1/3 innings), a \nleft-hander, included among his victories an upset of Chatsworth on the road. \nLeft-hander Canto Franco, the junior varsity league MVP last year, and \nsophomore right-hander Rick Savala are also in the running for a place in the \nrotation. \"With a lefty and righty in the starting rotation and a lefty and \nrighty in the bullpen, we look real strong with our pitching,\" Marden said. Two \nstarting position players return: third baseman Richard (Shorty) Sanchez and \noutfielder Octavio Serrano. Fernando Ortega and Roy Aguilera, reserves last \nyear, are among a large group fighting for outfield berths. Marden's biggest \ndiscovery could be shortstop Luis Rodriguez, a switch-hitting sophomore. \nRodriguez follows in the footsteps of All-City shortstops Bobby Corrales (1989) \nand Albert Torrez (1988). \"He's going to be better than both of them before \nhe's through,\" Marden predicted. \n\n\nOUTLOOK: The 1990 Tigers are similar to their predecessors in almost every \nrespect, Marden said, and status quo is fine with him. \"The key for us is to do \nwhat we do well -- put the ball in play, have solid pitching and play good \ndefense,\" Marden said. \"We play for one run an inning.\" Where do they rate? \"We \nmay not be as strong as some teams we've had in terms of returning starters,\" \nhe said. \"But nobody else does, either, except maybe for El Camino (Real).\" \n\n\nGranada Hills \n\n\nCOACH: Darryl Stroh, 21st year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 4-16; 4th in league at 1-15 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: Last season, Stroh's 20th as coach, was the worst in his \ntenure, a career that includes five 4-A City titles. Are his players intent on \nproving that 1989 was a fluke? Stroh says he doesn't know, and for good reason. \n\"We haven't spent any time talking about last year,\" he said. Based on the \nearly returns, '89 might have been an anomaly. The Highlanders won seven of \neight games in winter-league play, Stroh said, and have been opening some eyes \n-- namely his own. \"I've been pleasantly surprised,\" he said. Right-hander Gabe \nMiller returns as does left-hander Mike Komsky. Another familiar face will \nbrace the pitching staff -- football quarterback Bryan Martin. The younger \nbrothers of two former Highlander standouts will play at first. Josh Leach, \nwhose brother Jeremy played football and baseball, will see time at first along \nwith Robert Fowble, whose brother Greg also was a two-sport player. Second base \nwill be manned by either Todd Williams or Darryl Stroh Jr. Shortstop Jon \nCondos, a returning starter, \"has looked outstanding,\" Stroh said. Gabe Padilla \nor Derrick Cole will start at third. The outfield likely will consist of \nMartin, Alex Vasquez and Eric Anderson. Scott Berger, the lone sophomore on the \nteam, also might play in the outfield. Andy Petroski, a kicker on the football \nteam, is the catcher. \n\n\nOUTLOOK: Stroh says the team strength is undeniably its defense, \"but it'll all \nboil down to the pitching,\" he said. The team's superlative performance in \nwinter ball has left Stroh guardedly optimistic. \"We won seven of eight and we \nplayed well,\" he said, \"but we won something like three out of four last year \ntoo.\" \n\n\nCleveland \n\n\nCOACH: Rich Raymond, 1st year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 7-12-1; 3rd in league at 5-10-1 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: With the exception of returning All-City outfielder Pat \nBryant, the Cavaliers' strength also appears to be on the pitching rubber. A \npair of right-handers, Bobby Macias (5-11, 175) and Bobby McRae (6-5, 175), are \nthe likely starters. McRae, who starts on the basketball team and will be a \nlate arrival, was 2-5 with a 3.26 ERA last year. Sophomores Mike Petruzates, \nRobert Rundquist and Mario Macias, Bobby's brother, also will pitch. \nRight-hander Steve Pressler is a possible relief specialist. Petruzates and \nMcRae will alternate at first when not pitching. Sophomore Julio Marcial will \nstart at second and David Sipolla -- who batted a team-high .465 last year on \nthe junior varsity -- will play shortstop. Mike Sutyak, a junior, is the third \nbaseman. Macias and Petruzates are probable starters in the outfield. Bryant, a \nsenior who will start in center and bat first, hit .464 and stole 21 bases last \nyear. Both marks ranked first among returning area City players. He also drove \nin 14 runs and recorded team highs in doubles (five) and home runs (four). \n\n\nOUTLOOK: Raymond coached the Cleveland junior varsity last year, so he is \nfamiliar with the many youngsters who populate the Cavs' roster. He knows their \nstrengths, their limitations. \"Our sophomores are highly skilled,\" he said. \n\"Some have played for those world championship teams in Encino . . . but we're \nawful green and young.\" If the pitching comes through as expected and the \ndefense holds up -- a couple of big ifs -- Cleveland might well knock off some \nof the 4-A title contenders. \n\n\nWest Valley League \n\n\nEl Camino Real \n\n\nCOACH: Mike Maio, 8th year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 9-8; 3rd in league at 9-7 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: First things first. Maio wants everyone to be aware of one \nthing: \"I'm trying very hard to keep American Legion and El Camino baseball \nseparate.\" It might be a tall order. The Woodland Hills West Legion team won \nthe World Series title in August, and the majority of its players were from El \nCamino Real. Included on the West team were Ryan McGuire (first base), Pat \nTreend (pitcher), Jason Cohen (left field), Bobby Kim (catcher), Jeff Marks \n(right field), Greg Lederman (third base), Chris Castillo (outfield), Gregg \nSheren (infield), Chris Teich (infield) and Sean Boldt (pitcher). Of the group, \nfive were regulars. And if that's not enough, Herman Merchan (utility), who \nexcelled at St. Genevieve High and on the Panorama City Legion team, \ntransferred to El Camino Real over the summer. Seeking places on the pitching \nstaff are Corey Bromberg, Daniel Costa, Terry Morrow and Josh Massey. Maio's \ntoughest sell? \"I really believe that there are 15 teams in the Valley that can \nbeat us. . . . The notoriety they received doesn't mean a thing now.\" Boldt, a \njunior transfer from Canyon, might be a key. McGuire, a hard-throwing \nleft-hander, was effective during Legion play in late relief and would make an \nideal closer. If Boldt falters, however, the UCLA-bound McGuire might be used \nin the starting rotation. \n\n\nOUTLOOK: This team has been tabbed by many -- including most of the coaches in \nthe conference -- as the one to beat. Maio bristles at the thought. \"Look at \nall the No. 1 teams who lose. Granada Hills in football, Chatsworth was ranked \nNo. 1 in the nation (in baseball) by USA Today a couple of years ago and they \ndidn't win it, USC lost to Northridge (in baseball),\" he said. Are the players \nresponding? \"I think they're listening. I think I've made an impression.\" \n\n\nChatsworth \n\n\nCOACH: Tom Meusborn, 1st year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 21-7; 1st in league at 12-4 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: One of the most successful programs in the state, Chatsworth \nhas won or shared nine consecutive league titles. The good news for Meusborn is \nthat Chatsworth isn't favored to win the title this season. \"It doesn't make \nthat much difference to me,\" he said. \"We're going to play them game to game, \nweek to week. It won't make me happy to read that we're favored to win and it \nwon't make me mad if we're not favored.\" Right-hander Reed McMackin, part of \nthe Chancellors' starting rotation a year ago, returns after posting an 8-2 \nrecord with a 4.02 ERA. Left-hander Danny Rodriguez, a standout on the junior \nvarsity last year, is the probable No. 2 starter. Mitch Root, who will start in \ncenter field, will be the closer. Soly Maya (first base), Nestor Martinez \n(second), Tommy Lee (shortstop) and Adam Pearlman (third) all played for the \njunior varsity in 1989. Outfielder Rodney Bloom and catcher Mike Mancuso are \nreturning lettermen. Scott Carpenter is scheduled to play in right. \"When you \nlook at the roster, you see we have 11 seniors,\" Meusborn said. \"We're older \nthan most teams, but experience-wise, we're sort of green.\" \n\n\nOUTLOOK: \"I think we have some good pitching,\" Meusborn said. \"With Rodriguez \nand McMackin, we'll be in pretty good shape.\" Chatsworth is strong up the \nmiddle with Mancuso, Martinez, Lee and Root. But there is a preponderance of \nnew names. Derek Wallace, Eric Johnson, Jason Evans and Rich Aude -- all of \nwhom were both drafted and received scholarship offers -- have graduated. \nPerhaps Meusborn will soon find out the true strength of the Chatsworth \nprogram. \n\n\nTaft \n\n\nCOACH: Rich McKeon, 3rd year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 16-11; 2nd in league at 11-5 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: McKeon is left to sort through what remains of a \nsenior-dominated team that a year ago gave Chatsworth a run for the league \ntitle. Returning starters include Benji Belfield, a shortstop-relief pitcher \nwho had three saves and was 4-3 with a 4.94 ERA. Belfield also ranked among the \nteam's offensive leaders with seven extra-base hits and 15 RBIs. Brett Reisner \n(.246, 10 RBIs) returns in the outfield. Jamie Zeichick, a reserve last season \nafter having off-season shoulder surgery, will start in the outfield and bat \nfourth. The pitching staff is deep but untested. Battling for starting berths \nare senior left-hander Ryan Revel, sophomore left-hander Cory Jacobson, junior \nright-hander Eddie Soto and sophomore right-handers Sean Collins and Michael \nKrasner. Carey Wilbur, a varsity reserve last season as a junior, will start at \ncatcher. Sophomore John Erganian will play first base, freshman Warren Stewart \nand sophomore Matt Allison are battling it out at second, and freshman Brandon \nWitkow and Krasner are doing likewise at third. Darnell Hendricks, a speedy \njunior, will start in right. \n\n\nOUTLOOK: \"I'm hoping that we'll have a combination of leadership and youth,\" \nMcKeon said. McKeon also might have to rely on team speed to manufacture runs \nif the offense falters, a possibility given the experience of the team. \"We \nprobably have the quickest outfield around,\" he said. \"We may rely on team \nspeed in the top of the order.\" The team has more pitching depth than in the \npast, but experience is nil. Only Belfield has pitched at the varsity level. \n\n\nCanoga Park \n\n\nCOACH: Jim Smith, 2nd year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 3-13; 4th in league at 3-13 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: Smith is frank about the Hunters' chances. \"We've basically \ngot no pitching,\" he said. Senior left-hander Doug Van Horn, ineligible last \nseason, is the only player certain to see time on the mound. Ineligibility has \nravaged the team. \"We have 11, maybe 12 kids out,\" he said. \"We lost five kids \nto grades.\" Mike Bruce, a returning starter, will catch. \"He has a real good \narm,\" Smith said, which makes Bruce a possible pitching candidate. Returning \nlettermen Curt Sazzman and Valentine Douglas are waging a war for the nod at \nshortstop; the loser will play elsewhere in the infield. Doug Kreider, a \nreturning starter, will play at third. Mike Lewis returns in the outfield. Greg \nHurst also will play in the outfield. Leo Roldan is a possible starter at \nsecond, and Scott Blemker and Van Horn are expected to split time at first. \n\n\nOUTLOOK: \"The only thing we did decent in winter league was field the ball,\" \nSmith said. \"We faced some pretty weak pitching and didn't do too well against \nthat.\" Prospects don't look good, but Smith remains upbeat. \"We'll have fun,\" \nhe said. \"But I think it's going to be a long year.\" \n\n\nVALLEY PAC-8 CONFERENCE \n\n\nMid-Valley League \n\n\nBirmingham \n\n\nCOACH: Wayne Sink, 26th year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 8-12; 3rd in league at 6-10 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: A team of vast experience appropriately will play for Sink in \nhis 26th and final campaign as head coach. Nine returnees, headed by \noutfielders Bob Bookatz and Danny Larson, will be counted on for power. Bookatz \nbatted .420 as a junior. Larson led City players in triples with six. Also \ncoming back is senior infielder Justin Bass, who batted .343 in '89. The list \nof veterans also includes catchers Seth Rosenzweig and Marc Feder, pitchers \nJosh Brown and Jason Mansfield, probable leadoff hitter Ruben Flores and \ninfielder-pitcher Matt Mowry. \"It's a good nucleus to work with,\" Sink said. \nPlayers up from the junior varsity who will play key roles include first \nbaseman Mike Belasco, first baseman-pitcher Noah Kirshbaum, left fielder Mike \nMalki and outfielder Adam Kallen. Brown and Kirshbaum are the right-handed \nstarting pitchers and Mansfield is the lone left-handed starting pitcher. Mawry \nshould pitch some short relief. \n\n\nOUTLOOK: Sink is open in evaluating his swan song. \"What we have is \nexperience,\" he said. \"And the rest is up to them. They could have a great \nseason if they're motivated. But I can't go out there and hit that curveball.\" \nThe primary goal, Sink says, is the playoffs. But he would like to build from \nthere. \n\n\nMonroe \n\n\nCOACH: Kevin Campbell, 5th year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 11-11; 1st in league at 8-8 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: Monroe begins this season with something most teams would \nlove to have: a veteran pitcher. Sean Henson is a senior who ranked fourth \namong Valley-area City pitchers last season with a 2.08 earned-run average in \n64 innings. Henson also will play first base. Other returnees include shortstop \nand leadoff hitter John Langley, power-hitting outfielder Jeff Rubell and \noutfielder Jim Rose. Joining Henson in the rotation will be a pair of \nsophomores: Christian Ascencio, who doubles as a first baseman, and Adrian \nLoverich. \"One of those two will have to be a starter,\" Campbell said. The rest \nof the lineup is solid. San Fernando transfer Mario Gonzalez is a junior left \nfielder with good speed. Seniors Fran Espinosa and Chad Majers will play second \nbase and third base, respectively. \n\n\nOUTLOOK: With Henson, Monroe has a proven winner on the mound. \"Obviously, \nright now the question would be who will be our No. 2 starter,\" Campbell said. \nDefensively, the coach likes what he sees. As far as run production, Campbell \npegs that as a gray area. \"We need to improve our offense,\" he said. \"If we can \nget the ball in play, we'll be OK.\" \n\n\nVan Nuys \n\n\nCOACH: Bill Gordon, 1st year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 7-10; 2nd in league at 7-9 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: The biggest news so far during Gordon's short stay at Van \nNuys is, unfortunately, bad: Returning all-league senior shortstop Lorenzo \nMorales suffered pulled ligaments in his arm and is wearing a cast. \"Hopefully, \nhe'll return in three to four weeks,\" Gordon said. \"I say hopefully. He's our \nbest kid.\" In the meantime, Gordon looks to other returnees for leadership. \nJunior third baseman Hector Alvarenga is a letterman who will play shortstop \nuntil Morales returns. Seniors Martin Ramos (first base) and Carlos Gonzalez \n(outfield) also will start. The rest of the team is dominated by juniors, \nespecially the pitching. The top two starters are 11th-graders Tony Gonzalez \nand Jayme Jimenez, a pair of \"junk-ballers,\" according to Gordon. Morales, when \nhe returns, will relieve. Juniors David Gomez and Jesus Enciso join Gonzalez in \nthe outfield. Rare seniors in the lineup include second baseman Carlos \nGutierrez and catcher Marcos Espino. A positive note for Gordon has been the \nemergence of sophomore Patrick Alvarado, who \"is looking really good\" at third \nbase, according to Gordon. \n\n\nOUTLOOK: Gordon is cautiously optimistic. \"We want to be in every game,\" he \nsaid. \"But our primary goal is the playoffs.\" While Morales is gone, Gordon \nwill miss him like a soldier pining for home. In the meantime, Gordon looks \nahead with a bright eye. \"We've got to at least let them know that they've been \nin a ballgame,\" he said. \"We have the makings of a pretty darn good team.\" \n\n\nReseda \n\n\nCOACH: Mike Stone, 12th year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 4-14; 4th in league at 1-14 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: Stone is nearly positive that this year's team will fare \nbetter than last season's largely because of the emergence of steady -- albeit \ngreen -- pitching staff. A pair of sophomores -- Jesse Yeomans and Bebo \nGranello -- will start on the mound. Two football players -- Robert Reynoso and \nMike McCarthy -- will provide relief. Reseda's run production will be aided by \nveterans, notably junior Louis Vanacore, who batted .460 to finish third in the \nValley-area City batting race. He is joined by ex-football players Joe Tushnet, \na shortstop-center fielder who will bat first and provide speed, and Tuti \nRodriguez, a first baseman who will bat fourth. \"I'm expecting those guys to be \nreal solid .300 to .400 hitters,\" Stone said. The team's best player, according \nto Stone, is freshman David Barbares, a shortstop who won't join the team until \nhe's academically eligible in 10 weeks. \"He's gonna be a good one,\" Stone said. \n\n\nOUTLOOK: One thing is for sure, according to Stone: \"We're going to be a lot \nbetter than last year. Last year, we had no pitching. This year, we're in \nbetter shape. This year, we'll be there in the seventh inning.\" The big \nvariable, the coach says, will be the Regents' run production. \"It's a matter \nof offense,\" he said. \n\n\nEast Valley League \n\n\nSylmar \n\n\nCOACH: Gary Donatella, 2nd year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 19-4; 1st in league at 14-2 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: Sylmar lost three top pitchers from last season's City \nsemifinalists but that shouldn't stop Donatella's team from again making noise. \nLeading the way is Joe Contreraz, a senior third baseman who batted .351 last \nseason and was second among City area players in doubles with eight. Contreraz \nwill team with junior pitcher-outfielder Dereck Orneles in the heart of the \norder. Orneles can run, swing the bat and pitch, according to Donatella. \nJoining Orneles on the mound will be junior James Encinas, the team's top \npitcher. Seniors Gonzalo Hernandez and Danny Garcia also will pitch along with \nsophomore Jimmy Lemos. Leadoff hitter David Romero is a senior outfielder. \nUCLA-bound football player London Woodfin will provide power (he hit .343 last \nyear) when he returns in early April from arthroscopic knee surgery. Shortstop \nRoberto Garcia is sure-handed. \n\n\nOUTLOOK: Sylmar has the makings of another fine team. What this year's team \nlacks in quality pitching, Donatella said, it makes up for in quantity of \nreliable pitchers. \"Pitching is the key,\" he said. Scoring runs should be \nlittle problem with Contreraz, Orneles and Woodfin. Said Donatella: \"We're \ngoing to be around the top.\" \n\n\nPoly \n\n\nCOACH: Jerry Cord, 15th year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 15-9; 3rd in league at 11-5 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: Six returning lettermen join a group of talented young \nplayers, a mix that bodes well for the Parrots. Cord will look to senior \nright-hander David Giatti, whose strong junior season was cut short by arm \ntrouble that still hounds him. In 46 innings, Giatti led Valley-area City \npitchers with a 1.22 ERA. \"He's been throwing,\" Cord said. \"But who knows how \nhe'll come back?\" Joining Giatti in the rotation will be senior right-hander \nEddie Castellanos, who doubles as a designated-hitter. \"We're counting on those \ntwo to be mainstays,\" Cord said. Junior pitchers, including Rodrigo Dorame and \nRaul Torres, will get a chance to pitch. Other leading returnees are position \nplayers. Senior shortstop Gabe Chavez and junior outfielder Jonathan Campbell \nare powerful hitters. The top of the order includes second baseman Roy Lozano \nand leadoff hitter Will Molina, a center fielder. Much of the youth comes from \nthe 1989 Encino Pony League World champions: sophomores Steve Chavez (catcher), \nJesus Perez (outfielder) and Francisco Flores (first baseman). \n\n\nOUTLOOK: Poly has a legitimate shot at the title, but much depends on Giatti's \nrecovery. \"We're not gonna make a lot of mistakes defensively,\" Cord said. \"We \ncan make contact and score runs. The pitching is the only question. Somebody \nhas to step forward.\" \n\n\nGrant \n\n\nCOACH: Tom Lucero, 14th year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 16-5; 2nd in league at 12-3 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: Talk about youth: Grant has two returning lettermen, and one \nof them is still playing basketball. That leaves senior second baseman Steve \nPelote as the team's lone returning starter when play gets under way. \nAccordingly, Pelote will be counted on for big things. He batted .368 and drove \nin 25 runs last season. The other returnee is pitcher Billy May, a reserve \nforward on the basketball team. Lucero's No. 1 pitcher will be junior \nright-hander Gary Rosoff. Junior soccer player Holvik Castro pitched well in \nlast year's playoffs. More youth can be found in sophomore right-hander Tony \nKuper, a transfer from Antelope Valley. The lineup is somewhat shrouded in \nmystery at this point. Senior catcher Steve Gordon, junior second baseman \nBrandon Long and junior outfielder Shane Williams figure to bid for attention. \n\n\nOUTLOOK: The football and basketball teams already have won league titles, \nplacing the onus on Lucero's group to follow suit. Lucero says that the goals \nare there -- \"Obviously, we want to win the league title. We always shoot for \nthat.\" -- but the bodies remain in question. \"Having just two returners makes \nit difficult,\" he said. \"It's not like the past where I could rely on a Rodney \nBeck or a Javier Delahoya. We're trying to find the right combinations. We're \nso young and so competitive. There's some enthusiasm.\" \n\n\nNorth Hollywood \n\n\nCOACH: Marty Biegel, 1st year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 3-13; 4th in league at 3-13 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: The first name Biegel mentions when discussing the team uad \nis senior shortstop Eric Martinez. \"He's got All-City potential,\" he said. \nBiegel also praises No. 3 hitter and football star Mike Lewis. Two pieces of \nthe puzzle will not report until after the basketball season: first baseman \nHarry Marks and leadoff hitter-center fielder Duane Braxton. \"Duane's my table \nsetter,\" Biegel said. \"He's got great speed and he's a great defensive \noutfielder.\" Biegel's top two pitchers are right-handers Sammy Ciaramarilo and \nCraig White, a junior varsity basketball player. The outfield contains good \nfielders in Nelson Pichardo and Ozzie Collins. Second baseman Carlos Olmos, an \nOrel Hershiser lookalike, according to Biegel, along with infielders Adrian \nPadilla and Charlie Lee will see playing time. Three are vying for the \ncatcher's job: Steve Macias, Livan Cartaya and Ivan Guillermo. Jose Ortiz also \ncould squeeze in some playing time for Biegel. \n\n\nOUTLOOK: \"We'll go as far as our pitching carries us,\" Biegel said. \"We will \nscore runs, that I know.\" And with Biegel, the ebullient New Yorker at the \nhelm, there is no shortage of enthusiasm. \"The kids have been absolutely \nbeautiful in their accepting of a new guy on the block,\" he said. As for the \nleague race? \"We'll be competitive,\" the coach assured. \n\n\nNORTHERN CONFERENCE \n\n\nNortheastern League \n\n\nVerdugo Hills \n\n\nCOACH: David Richard, 1st year \n\n\nLAST SEASON: 12-12; 3rd in league at 9-7 \n\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH: For the first time, the Dons will have an on-campus baseball \ndiamond. And despite having just one returning varsity player, Richard might \nhave carved out a respectable team to play at the new facility too. \"Whenever a \nnew guy comes into a program, they always say it'll take a year,\" said Richard, \n20, a walk-on and former junior varsity coach at Marshall. \"But I told the \nkids, 'Let's start now.' There's no reason to shine this year off.\" Pat \nHernandez, who starts at third base, is the lone returning letterman, and he \nwill be expected to anchor an infield of considerable inexperience. First \nbaseman Stan Hessinger, second baseman Larry Gouger and shortstop Pat Eubanks \nall are sophomores. There are two sophomores in the outfield, Matt Ward and Ray \nMedina. Richard calls Ward, \"the one to watch.\" Senior Jeff Martinez starts in \nleft. The pitching staff, which Richard calls his main concern, consists of \nright-handed seniors Chad Runnels and Scott Boudreaux and junior right-hander \nJohn Bishop. \"If we get the pitching taken care of, we'll be OK,\" Richard said. \n\n\nOUTLOOK: Verdugo Hills played well in a scrimmage against Van Nuys on Tuesday, \nwhich made Richard feel a lot better about the big picture. \"We've come a long, \nlong way,\" he said. \"I'm really impressed with the work ethic. Everybody has a \ngreat attitude.\" Richard has successfully cleared the first hurdle -- \nrecruiting key young players from the student body. Whether the older players \ncan contribute in uncertain; last season, the junior varsity did not win a \ngame."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0212", "docId": "180132", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition", "section": "Sports; Part C; Page 11B; Column 5; Sports Desk", "length": "235", "headline": "SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: AZTECS SCORE FIVE IN 7TH, SHUT OUT CAL LUTHERAN", "byline": null, "type": null, "graphic": null, "text": "The San Diego State baseball team scored five runs in the seventh inning and \nshut out Cal Lutheran, 7-0, at Smith Field Wednesday.

William Seidman, a federal banking regulator, fired the latest salvo in the \ngrowing war between credit unions and bankers Tuesday when he told an American \nBankers Assn. gathering that credit union executives aren't being truthful by \nclaiming that their insurance fund is stronger than the insurance fund that \ncovers savings accounts held by bank and S&L customers. \n\n\nSeidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution \nTrust Corp., also suggested that the fast-growing credit union industry is \ninvesting in areas in which it lacks expertise. \n\n\nHal Stephens, president of San Diego-based Mission Federal Credit Union, which \nhas 75,000 members, described Seidman's remarks as proof that bankers, and \nbanking regulators \"want to destroy us. They see us growing . . . with a 6% \nshare of total consumer savings, and they want that business.\" \n\n\nBankers have watched with envy during the past decade as credit unions became \none of the nation's fastest-growing financial service sectors. Assets at the \nnation's 15,086 credit unions stood at $203 billion on Dec. 31, 1989, up from \n$64.2 billion in 1979. Membership has soared to 60.4 million, up from 41.4 \nmillion in 1979. \n\n\nJerry Karbon, a spokesman for the Madison, Wis.-based Credit Union National \nAssn., on Wednesday agreed that credit unions have enjoyed dramatic growth. \n\"That growth has been controlled growth and wise growth,\" Karbon said. \"There's \nno reason to be worried about credit unions' health and safety.\" \n\n\n\"Far more banks and S&Ls than credit unions have closed in recent years,\" \nsaid Karbon, who predicted that the General Accounting Office and the U.S. \nTreasury will document the credit unions' financial strength in current \nreviews. \n\n\nCredit unions believe their growth is directly tied to the wave of expanded \nservices that have been added to meet customer demand. Besides their \ntraditional car loans, many credit unions now offer credit cards, checking and \nsaving accounts, individual retirement accounts and home loans. Some offer \nloans to small business operations and others offer basic stock-brokerage \nservices. \n\n\nCredit unions also point to customer satisfaction surveys that show credit \nunion members to be extremely satisfied with how they are served by credit \nunions. \n\n\nBut bankers view those expanded services as an encroachment on their \ntraditional turf. They also maintain that credit unions enjoy an unfair \ncompetitive advantage through their long-standing exemption from paying federal \nincome taxes. \n\n\nCredit unions have escaped unscathed when past congresses were eliminating tax \nexemptions. But Stephens and other credit union spokesmen acknowledged \nWednesday that bankers will be pressing hard during the coming year to \neliminate the tax exemption for credit unions. \n\n\n\"Bankers have always been after our tax status, but we're a financial \ncooperative, and our earnings go back to our members, Stephens said. \"So what \ndo they want to tax? To us, it seems that they've pretty well busted up the \nS&L industry, and now they want to take us apart.\" \n\n\nDespite their remarkable growth during the past decade, credit unions still \nplay a relatively small role in the financial services industry. \"Citicorp is \nlarger than all the credit unions combined,\" Stephens said. \"We're really not \nthat big, with just 6% of personal savings.\" \n\n\nBut, wary of bankers' intentions, credit unions are asking their 60.4 million \nmembers to let Congress know that \"anything they do will be remembered during \nthe next election,\" Stephens said. \n\n\nKarbon expects more pressure during the next year to \"streamline and \nconsolidate the existing regulatory system\" by combining the credit union's \ndeposit insurance fund with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which last \nyear absorbed the financially troubled Federal Savings & Loan Insurance \nCorp. \n\n\nCredit union industry executives will fight to retain their historical customer \nbase, said Tena Lozano, a spokeswoman for the Pomona-based California Credit \nUnion League. \n\n\nCredit unions have faithfully served \"customers that banks weren't interested \nin\" when federal legislators created the credit union industry during the \n1930s. \"Now, suddenly, they're interested,\" Lozano said. \n\n\nBut Stephens argues that increased market share isn't the only reason that \nbankers are attacking credit unions. \n\n\n\"We're the only financial organizations with the chance of giving them a run \nfor (consumers') money,\" Stephens said. \"But banks have had tremendous losses. \nThey have terrible problems with LBOs (leveraged buyouts) and foreign loans. \nThey're trying to take the pressure off of themselves\" by attacking credit \nunions. \n\n\nCREDIT UNION GROWTH \n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n1979 \n\n  \n\n1984 \n\n  \n\n1989 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nNumber of unions \n\n  \n\n21,983 \n\n  \n\n18,375 \n\n  \n\n15,086 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nMembers \n\n  \n\n41.4 million \n\n  \n\n49.3 million \n\n  \n\n60.4 million \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nAssets \n\n  \n\n$64.2 billion \n\n  \n\n$113 billion \n\n  \n\n$203 billion \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nLoans \n\n  \n\n$51.2 billion \n\n  \n\n$75.4 billion \n\n  \n\n$134.9 billion \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nSavings deposits \n\n  \n\n$55.9 billion \n\n  \n\n$102.6 billion \n\n  \n\n$184.8 billion \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nSource: The Credit Union National Assn."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0214", "docId": "180134", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition", "section": "Calendar; Part F; Page 1; Column 2; Entertainment Desk", "length": "941", "headline": "GUGGENHEIM DEAL LEAVES PANZA'S CALIFORNIA ART IN PLAY", "byline": "By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC", "type": null, "graphic": "Photo, GIUSEPPE PANZA DI BIUMO, on his collection of California art", "text": "New York's Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation may have acquired the lion's share \nof Italian Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo's contemporary American art collection \nlast weekend, but very little of his coveted California art was included in the \narrangement, the count revealed in an interview this week. \n\n\n\"I retain ownership of the largest part of the California art, about 80 works \nof Light and Space art plus some new work I acquired in the past two years,\" \nthe indefatigable 67-year-old collector said from his New York hotel. \"I have \nalways been interested in having the part of my collection that includes \nCalifornia artists in California. I hope this will become true one day, but it \nis a question of finding the right sponsor. \n\n\n\"If a sponsor will pay for a building, I will make a gift for such a project to \nkeep the works all together and have them in California.\" \n\n\nFormer hopefuls who thought the Guggenheim purchase had made them also-rans \nbrightened when apprised of this new twist. \"I would never foreclose on such an \nidea,\" said County Art Museum Director Earl A. (Rusty) Powell. \"I'm glad the \ndoor is still open.\" \n\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art Director Richard Koshalek said that if the \nCalifornia works remain available, he would like to \"explore and discuss\" their \nacquisition. In 1983, Los Angeles' Museum of Contemporary Art purchased Panza's \n80-work Abstract Expressionist and classic Pop compendium for $11 million to \nform the core of its permanent collection. \n\n\nFor the last decade, Powell, Koshalek and virtually every other museum director \nin California hoped to obtain Panza's collection of several hundred works of \nMinimalist and Conceptual art of the '60s and '70s. Widely praised as the \nfinest private holding of its type, it was particularly attractive here because \nof heavy representation of so-called California Light and Space art. The style \nis regarded as among the most original in contemporary art and involved the \ntalents of such innovators as Robert Irwin, James Turrell, Doug Wheeler, Eric \nOrr and Maria Nordman. \n\n\n\"I have always personally regretted that this amazing holding has not found a \nhome here,\" said Henry Hopkins, director of the Frederick R. Weisman Collection \nand former director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. \n\n\nHopkins thought he detected a shift in Panza's conditions. \"He seems to have \nmoved from a previous position where he wanted first a long-term loan followed \nby a purchase, to a new posture, where he is willing to make a gift in exchange \nfor a building. I would still hope we could affect this as a possibility. The \nart program of the Santa Monica Art Commission or the expanded Newport Harbor \nArt Museum seem like possibilities.\" \n\n\nHenry Korn, who heads the Santa Monica Art Commission, confirmed that \"during \nthe past year or so,\" he and Panza discussed the possibility of installing the \nCalifornia works in a hangar-like building that would be constructed at the \nSanta Monica airport but termed the negotiations \"speculative and \ninconclusive.\" \n\n\nPanza has held an extraordinarily large number of such discussions with museum \nprofessionals throughout Europe and America, displaying great zeal and idealism \nin regard to his collections. However, only one deal was actually cut prior to \nthe Guggenheim arrangement, the sale to MOCA. According to one expert, those \nworks are worth as much as $100 million today and are unavailable at any price. \n\n\nA consistent Panza profile emerges from accounts given by art administrators \nwho have dealt with him. Ever polite, attentive and interested, he pursues \nnegotiations to the point of practical action and then \"it all just sort of \nevaporates,\" said one frustrated suitor who asked not to be named. \"It's like \npunching taffy.\" \n\n\nPanza became a player on the Los Angeles scene when artist Robert Irwin \nintroduced him to MOCA in 1981. Panza approached the county museum's receptive \nPowell in 1985. Talks snagged on Panza's insistence that his room-filling \ninstallation works be kept together and on view. \n\n\nPowell, realizing this was a physical impossibility for his museum, then put \ntogether an informal consortium of MOCA Director Richard Koshalek, Hugh Davies \nof the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art and Hopkins, who then directed the \nSan Francisco museum. The idea was to forge an arrangement whereby Panza's \nworks would rotate among the four museums with some prominently on view in each \nplace. The proposal was never accepted or rejected by Panza. \n\n\nThe Guggenheim agreement includes more than 300 works. About half the art, by \nsuch key figures as Brice Marden, Robert Ryman, Donald Judd and Richard Serra, \nwill be purchased by the institution over six years for an unrevealed price \nbelieved to be in the tens of millions of dollars. \n\n\nWorks that are physically movable will come to rest in the Guggenheim's \nspiraling Frank Lloyd Wright building on Fifth Avenue, but insiders are \nwondering how the museum will pay for the purchase and where it will house the \nwork. Guggenheim Foundation director Thomas Krens did not return calls from The \nTimes. \n\n\nThe balance of the acquisition will be a gift to the museum from Panza and will \ninclude the buildings and land of his estate in Varese, outside Milan. It \nhouses many space-gobbling installations by the Californians and such other \nluminaries as Dan Flavin, Sol LeWitt and Walter de Maria. The estate will \nbecome a public museum operated through an endowment from the local Italian \ngovernment and administered by the Guggenheim. \n\n\nThe foundation, which is known to have a longstanding interest in increasing \nits presence in Europe, has a museum in Venice, the Peggy Guggenheim \nCollection."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0215", "docId": "180141", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M.

I heard about him a great deal and reports on him \nand so forth.\" \n\n\nReagan acknowledged that he supported the solicitation of donations from \nforeign governments and others who could help finance the Contra effort. \n\n\nAlthough the law banned direct U.S. military aid to the rebels, Reagan said, \n\"there wasn't any restriction on . . . informing others as to how they could \nhelp, things of that kind. And that I did approve.\" \n\n\nReagan also testified that he wasn't aware that money was being diverted from \nthe Iran arms sales to the Contras. \n\n\n\"I was only aware finally that we got our 12-million-2,\" Reagan said, referring \nto the $12.2 million the U.S. government received for providing weapons to \nIran. \n\n\n\"May I simply point out that I had no knowledge then or now that there had been \na diversion, and I never used the term,\" the former President said. \"And all I \nknew was that there was some money that came from some place in another \naccount, and that the appearance was that it might have been part of the \nnegotiated sale.\" \n\n\nWebb asked: \"To the extent that there was in fact a diversion of proceeds, did \nyou in any way approve or authorize that while you were President of the United \nStates?\" \n\n\n\"For heaven's sake, no,\" Reagan replied. \"And when I was once asked about that \nextra money and said if it was an added sum to the purchase price, what would I \ndo, I said I would have given it back.\" \n\n\nHe added: \"No one has proven to me that there was a diversion.\" \n\n\n\"To this day, all I know is that some sum of money over and above the \n$12.2-million purchase price appeared in a Swiss bank account in which it was \nsaid that account had been used on another occasions (sic) to provide help to \nthe Contras,\" Reagan said. \n\n\n\"And to this day, I still with all of the investigations that have been made, I \nstill have never been given one iota of evidence as to who collected the price, \nwho delivered the final delivery of the weapons . . . whether there was ever \nmore money in that Swiss account that had been diverted someplace else. \n\n\n\"I am still waiting to find those things out and have never found them out,\" \nReagan said. \n\n\nPoindexter is charged with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and \ntwo counts of making false statements in connection with the Iran-Contra \naffair. \n\n\nSpecifically, he is accused of covering up from Congress North's secret \nassistance to the Contras and knowledge by government officials of a 1985 \nshipment of Hawk missiles to Iran. \n\n\nPoindexter's lawyers sought Reagan's testimony in an attempt to show that the \nPresident approved of his national security adviser's activities. \n\n\nJudge Greene ordered the release of a transcript of Reagan's eight hours of \ntestimony but barred the news media from making copies of the videotape for \nbroadcast. \n\n\nIn his order, Greene rejected arguments by Poindexter and Reagan for delaying \nthe release of the testimony."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0216", "docId": "180142", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley P.M.

Some feel the \nconcentration of pressure involved in the American Triple Crown places a \nfearsome burden on a horse. Others feel it is more difficult to keep a horse in \ntop condition for the longer period of time involved in the English Triple \nCrown. Suffice to say, both series are difficult to sweep. There have been 11 \nwinners of the U.S. Triple Crown since Sir Barton was the first in 1919. \nAffirmed, in 1978, was the last. West Australian was the first to sweep the \nEnglish Triple Crown (the 2,000 Guineas, the Derby and St. Leger) in 1853, and \n15 horses have done it. The last was Nijinsky II in 1970, and he was the first \nsince Bahram in 1935. The English Triple Crown does not seem to hold the same \nappeal for horsemen in that country these days as the American Triple Crown \namong horsemen in this country. \n\n\nQ: I am fascinated by the distinction made between races at a mile and a 16th \nand races at a mile and 70 yards. The two distances are so close together, for \na mile and a 16th is a mile and 110 yards. Why do tracks offer both distances \nwhen they are almost the same thing? \n\n\nA: It is often a matter of psychology. The racing secretary is trying to \nattract the best possible racing material for his programs. Some trainers may \nfeel that their horse doesn't have the stamina to stay a mile and a 16th but \nmight be able to win at a mile and 70 yards. Department stores practice the \nsame psychology by pricing items at $99, rather than $100. \n\n\nQ: When I handicap the races, I compare the best previous times of the horses \nin that race at the distance in question. Some of my friends discount the best \ntime as having little significance. What do you think? \n\n\nA: \"The quality of the race can make a difference,\" said Leroy Jolley, the Hall \nof Fame trainer who saddled Kentucky Derby winners Foolish Pleasure and Genuine \nRisk. \"Cheap horses are not consistent and can turn in a good time one day and \na slow time the next. In some instances they are favored by certain track \nconditions, or perhaps they can get an easy lead in some races and nurse it all \nthe way. Good horses, on the other hand, hold their form longer, and if they \nrun in fast time, they are more likely to run back in comparable time than \ncheap horses. Not all the time, but more often. Thus, in better races, the best \ntimes are probably more significant.\" \n\n\nQ: Like many others, I have read many stories and am concerned about the number \nof fractures occurring among our racehorses. Isn't it possible to alleviate \nthis situation to some degree by feeding a heavier calcium diet to horses, thus \nbuilding stronger bone? \n\n\nA: \"In the absence of a marked deficiency of calcium in the body makeup, it has \nbeen proven to the satisfaction of most professionals that a high calcium diet \nis not effective in the prevention of fractures in racehorses,\" said the noted \nMidwestern veterinarian, Dr. Robert Copeian. \"Levels of calcium above the norm \nare rejected by the body.\""}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0241", "docId": "180203", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M.

Associated Press", "text": "It was 10 years ago this week that the U.S. Olympic hockey team stuck its foot \ninto the glass slipper and walked away with a gold medal at Lake Placid, a \nfairy tale if there ever was one, and boy, where does the time go? Herb Brooks \nlooked so young and mean back then, and like his players, it's hard to imagine \nhim ever growing old. And now Herb Brooks is 52. \n\n\nThe legend of Lake Placid has aged, too, a few of the details growing fuzzy, \nthe mind playing a few tricks. But the story endures because the kids from the \nUnited States did more than just capture a championship. They began the \nOlympics as long shots; they left as heroes. \n\n\nThey wrote a happy ending. \n\n\nThese weren't high-priced superstars tooling around in Ferraris and hanging out \nat Elaine's. They were collegians and failed minor-leaguers giving it their \nbest shot. The Soviets were big and powerful -- invincible, we all thought. \nTeam U.S.A. was made up of youngsters from down the block who mowed your lawn. \n\n\n\"I remember a meeting we had early on, after the team was picked,\" said Rob \nMcClanahan, a center on the team and now a sales broker in Chicago. \"Herb gave \nus a talk and although he didn't say this exactly, the message was something \nlike, 'If we play very well, get some breaks, we could win a bronze medal. If \nwe play over our heads, catch a huge break, we can get a silver. The gold is \nthe Russians'. Forget about it.' \" \n\n\nBut it has been a long time, so every once in a while the memories become \nblurred. A guy will say, \"Remember the night the U.S.A. beat the Soviets and \nwon the gold medal?\" And, of course, it didn't happen that way at all. The \nUnited States beat the Soviets all right, 10 years ago today. But it was two \ndays later -- Feb. 24, 1980 -- that the Americans clinched the gold medal by \ndefeating Finland. Odd, but that game is like a footnote now. \n\n\n\"Know what?\" asked Mark Johnson, who plays for the New Jersey Devils these \ndays. \"Everyone thinks we won the gold medal in the game against the Russians, \nexcept the people who were there.\" It's as if as long as they beat the Soviets, \nnothing else matters. \n\n\nBut it does. Those upstarts from small towns like Grand Rapids, Minn., and \nCharleston, Mass., tossing their sticks in the air, Mike Eruzione collapsed in \ntears, Jim Craig wrapped in an American flag and asking, \"Where's my father?\" \n-- that was like something out of a TV movie. Naturally, it became one. If you \nhappened to miss it, it was called \"Miracle on Ice.\" \n\n\n\"The movie?\" McClanahan said. \"To me, it was a little sappy.\" \n\n\nLike anything else, the movie exaggerated a few facts, ignored some others, and \nsquashed eight months of practice, travel and competition into three hours in \nprime time. It came across like a real tear-jerker, all hearts and flowers. The \nfact is, the Olympians rode a bumpy path to Lake Placid. People forget that. \n\n\nBy the time the Americans arrived, they were exhausted and cranky from a \nnationwide tour. There was some squabbling. And the country really didn't take \nmuch notice of the team until the game against the Soviets, a story in itself. \n\n\nThe Soviets had demolished the United States, 10-3, in a pre-Olympic game at \nMadison Square Garden. So Brooks figured he'd better have something good to say \nto inspire his young players. \n\n\nThe locker room was hushed when he stood up before the game, reached into his \npocket and fished out a wrinkled slip of paper. And then he said: \n\n\n\"You are born to be a player. You are meant to be here at this time. This is \nyour moment.\" \n\n\nAs speeches go, it was right up there with Knute Rockne telling Notre Dame to \nwin one for the Gipper. But, it turns out, Brooks really hadn't been sure of \nwhat he wanted to say. He scribbled down a few notes and phrases and then kind \nof blurted them out, not exactly the way the story has been passed down. \n\n\nBrooks laughs about it now. \"It just sort of came out the way it did,\" he said. \n\"Let me tell you something, it was no Gettysburg Address.\" \n\n\nLet's just say it did the job. Johnson's shot with one second left in the first \nperiod pulled the United States into a 2-2 tie and the Soviets, panicking, \nyanked their famous goalie, Vladislav Tretiak. Behind in the third period, 3-2, \nthe Americans fought back with goals by Dave Silk and Eruzione, won the game, \n4-3, and the fable began to unfold. \n\n\nThe natural reaction was to think that the dispirited Soviets had nothing but \ncontempt for the Americans. It also was natural to think the Americans loved \nsticking it to the Soviets, their being Communists and all. But as Eruzione \nsaid, \"We were athletes, and to us it was an athletic event. We didn't think of \nit as a political event.\" \n\n\nThat victory got the puck rolling. \n\n\nDefenseman Ken Morrow would go on to win four Stanley Cups with the New York \nIslanders after winning the gold medal and now is an assistant coach with the \nNew York Rangers' farm team in Flint, Mich. Craig rebounded from a brief, \ncheckered NHL career, eventually was cleared of criminal charges stemming from \na fatal automobile accident, and currently is a sales representative in \nBrockton, Mass. Mark Pavelich, who always skated to his own beat, hunts and \nfishes in the Minnesota woods. \n\n\nBut it's funny how things work out sometimes. Johnson and Viacheslav Fetisov, \nthe great Soviet defenseman, are teammates now with the Devils. \n\n\nThirteen of the Olympians, plus Brooks and assistant Coach Craig Patrick, rode \nthe wave of popularity to careers in the NHL. For most of them, though, there's \nbeen nothing like the afternoon they beat the Finns, 4-2, for the gold medal \nwhile the crowd in Lake Placid chanted, \"U.S.A.!\" \n\n\nOf course, the line that everyone remembers is Al Michaels shouting: \"Do you \nbelieve in miracles?\" Now, the word \"miracle\" gets a lot of exposure, what with \nevery game-winning ground-rule double immediately videotaped and immortalized. \nThe Americans, all freckles and goose bumps, coming out of nowhere to beat the \nodds and win the gold -- that may not exactly qualify as a miracle. \n\n\nBut it's close."}, {"docNum": "LA022290-0243", "docId": "180211", "date": "February 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M.

Along with former Beatle Paul McCartney, the celebrated \ntrumpeter was to be honored with a prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award. \n\n\nBut Davis, who has won four previous Grammys, also picked up his fifth and \nsixth Grammys. \n\n\nDuring pre-telecast ceremonies -- in which 61 of the evening's 77 awards were \nannounced -- Davis was saluted for best jazz instrumental performance by a big \nband during 1989 and for best jazz instrumental by a soloist, both in \nconnection with his album, \"Aura.\" \n\n\nThe Recording Academy was also scheduled to give two posthumous Lifetime \nAchievement Awards during the telecast to singer Nat King Cole and pianist \nVladimir Horowitz. Dick Clark was to be presented with a Trustees Award, for \nachievements in the non-performing side of the industry. \n\n\nGrammy winners are chosen by the nearly 6,000 active members of the National \nAcademy of Recording Arts & Sciences, a nonprofit organization formed to \nrepresent all segments of the recording industry. \n\n\nBonnie Raitt was one of the evening's other multiple winners. She was saluted \nfor best female rock vocal and traditional blues recording, sharing the latter \nwith John Lee Hooker for their duet on \"I'm in the Mood.\" \n\n\nOther artists who received multiple awards included British soul-dance group \nSoul II Soul and composer-arranger Dave Grusin. \n\n\nSoul II Soul won the R&B group vocal award for the single \"Back to Life,\" \nand the R&B instrumental Grammy for \"African Dance,\" a selection from the \ngroup's \"Keep on Movin' \" album. The group, however, lost in the more-prized \nbest new artist category to the duo Milli Vanilli. \n\n\nGrusin, winner of three previous Grammys, picked up three more. They were for \nthe background score of the film \"The Fabulous Baker Boys,\" instrumental \narrangement for the suite from the film \"The Milagro Beanfield War\" and \ninstrumental arrangement with a vocal for the rendition of \"My Funny Valentine\" \nin \"'Baker Boys.\" \n\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys, the veteran rock superstar quintet that was widely \nviewed in the recording industry as the betting favorite in the competition for \nkey album of the year, were also honored during the pre-telecast portion of the \nprogram for the best group vocal in rock. \n\n\nThe group consists of rock veterans Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Tom \nPetty and Orbison. \n\n\nLiving Colour's \"Cult of Personality\" single was named best hard rock \nperformance of 1989, shutting out the controversial Los Angeles-based hard-rock \nband Guns N' Roses. The latter group had been widely criticized for allegedly \nracist remarks in a song, \"One in a Million,\" that was included in its \"GN'R \nLies\" album, which was a contender in the hard-rock category. \n\n\nAbout 10 members from the Los Angeles chapter of the Guardian Angels, the \nself-styled crime fighters, marched in front of the Shrine on Wednesday, \nhanding out leaflets that branded \"One in a Million\" as racist for its use of \nracial epithets, and New York rap group's Public Enemy's \"Welcome to the \nTerrordome\" as anti-Semitic. \n\n\nPublic Enemy -- whose \"Fight the Power\" single was a nominee in the rap \ncategory -- has been criticized by Jewish leaders and others for possible \nanti-Semitic attitudes since a controversial interview by Professor Griff, the \ngroup's former \"minister of information,\" that appeared last May in the \nWashington Times newspaper. \n\n\nBoth Axl Rose, the lead singer of Guns N' Roses, and Chuck D., the leader of \nPublic Enemy, have denied racist or bigoted attitudes. \n\n\nHarry Connick Jr.'s victory in the male jazz vocal category Wednesday is likely \nto stir criticism from the purist wing of the jazz community that has tended to \nthink of Connick primarily as a cabaret or pop singer. In picking up his first \nGrammy for his contributions to the \"When Harry Meets Sally\" film sound track \nalbum, Connick defeated past jazz Grammy winners Joe Williams and George \nBenson. \n\n\nTwo names more commonly associated with pop and rock, Dr. John and Rickie Lee \nJones, were also honored for best jazz vocal by a duo or group. They teamed up \non a version of \"Makin' Whoopee.\" \n\n\nVeteran Ruth Brown, a star over the years in jazz, blues and rock fields, was \nnamed best female jazz vocalist for her album, \"Blues on Broadway.\" \n\n\nThe Pat Metheny Group was honored for jazz fusion performance for the fifth \ntime since the category was initiated in 1979. \n\n\nChick Corea, who had won seven previous Grammys, was honored for best jazz \ngroup instrumental for his album, \"Chick Corea Akoustic Band.\" \n\n\nBobby Brown was named best male R&B vocalist, Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff's \n\"If You Don't Know Me by Now\" was named best R&B song. \n\n\nIn the country field, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's \"Will the Circle Be \nUnbroken, Volume Two\" was associated with three awards. The band itself won a \nGrammy for best group vocal, defeating the Judds, who had finished on top in \nthis category two of the last three years. The band also shared a Grammy with \nBruce Hornsby for best blue grass recording, while Randy Scruggs was cited as \nbest country instrumentalist for his work on a song, \"Amazing Grace,\" that \nappeared on the \"Circle\" album. \n\n\nRodney Crowell's \"After All This Time\" was declared best country song. \n\n\nThe Indigo Girls' debut album was judged the top contemporary folk recording. \nThe traditional folk Grammy was awarded to the Bulgarian State Female Vocal \nChoir, a group that had made a considerable pop splash during 1989. \n\n\nLos Lobos was judged the best Mexican-American performance. \n\n\nThe late actress-comedian Gilda Radner was honored for best spoken word \nrecording for her, \"It's Always Something.\" \n\n\n\"Jerome Robbins' Broadway\" was named best musical cast show album. \n\n\nIn the composition categories, Carly Simon's \"Let the River Run\" (from the film \n\"Working Girl\") was named best song written for a movie, while Danny Elfman's \n\"Batman\" theme was voted best instrumental composition. \n\n\nPOP WINNERS \n\n\nAlbum: \"Nick of Time,\" Bonnie Raitt. \n\n\nPop Instrumental: \"Healing Chant,\" Neville Brothers. \n\n\nRock Vocal by Duo or Group: \"Traveling Wilburys, Volume One,\" Traveling \nWilburys. \n\n\nRock Instrumental: \"Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop with Terry Bozzio and Tony Hymas,\" \nJeff Beck with Terry Bozzio and Tony Hymas. \n\n\nR&B Vocal by Duo or Group: \"Back to Life,\" Soul II Soul. \n\n\nR&B Instrumental: \"African Dance,\" Soul II Soul. \n\n\nR&B Song: \"If You Don't Know Me by Now,\" Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. \n\n\nNew Age: \"Passion -- Music for the Last Temptation of Christ,\" Peter Gabriel. \n\n\nJazz Fusion: \"Letter From Home,\" Pat Metheny Group. \n\n\nJazz Vocal by Duo or Group: \"Makin' Whoopee,\" Dr. John and Rickie Lee Jones. \n\n\nSolo Jazz Instrumental: \"Aura,\" Miles Davis. \n\n\nGroup Jazz Instrumental: \"Chick Corea Akoustic Band,\" Chick Corea Akoustic \nBand. \n\n\nBig Band Jazz Instrumental: \"Aura,\" Miles Davis. \n\n\nCountry Vocal by Duo or Group: \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken Volume Two,\" Nitty \nGritty Dirt Band. \n\n\nCountry Vocal Collaboration: \"There's a Tear in My Beer,\" Hank Williams Jr. and \nHank Williams Sr. \n\n\nCountry Instrumental: \"Amazing Grace,\" Randy Scruggs. \n\n\nBluegrass: \"The Valley Road,\" Bruce Hornsby and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. \n\n\nCountry Song: \"After All This Time,\" Rodney Crowell. \n\n\nFemale Gospel Vocal: \"Don't Cry,\" CeCe Winans. \n\n\nMale Gospel Vocal: \"Meantime,\" BeBe Winans. \n\n\nGospel Vocal by Duo or Group: \"The Savior is Waiting,\" Take 6. \n\n\nMale/Female Soul Gospel Vocal: \"As Long As We're Together,\" Al Green. \n\n\nSoul Gospel Vocal by Duo, Group, Choir or Chorus: \"Let Brotherly Love \nContinue,\" Daniel Winans & Choir. \n\n\nTropical Latin: \"Ritmo En El Corazon,\" Celia Cruz & Ray Barretto. \n\n\nTraditional Blues: \"I'm in the Mood,\" John Lee Hooker and Bonnie Raitt. \n\n\nContemporary Blues: \"In Step,\" Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble. \n\n\nTraditional Folk: \"Le Mystere Des Voix Bulgares, Volume II,\" Bulgarian State \nFemale Vocal Choir. \n\n\nContemporary Folk: \"Indigo Girls,\" Indigo Girls. \n\n\nPolka: \"All in My Love for You,\" Jimmy Sturr & his Orchestra. \n\n\nReggae: \"Serious Business,\" Third World. \n\n\nChildren: \"The Rock-A-Bye Collection Volume I,\" Tanya Goodman. \n\n\nComedy: \"P.D.Q.

HENRY DIROCCO / For The \nTimes; Photo, SOPRANO'S SAGA: Soprano Ealynn Voss, above, who sings the titular \nheroine of Puccini's \"Turandot\" for Opera Pacific at the Orange County \nPerforming Arts Center tonight, has traveled a long way since scrubbing floors \nin Malibu.", "text": "When last we saw soprano Ealynn Voss, she was one of the hopefuls who had \nturned up at Opera Pacific auditions for secondary roles, apprentices and \nchorus members nearly three years ago at Cal State Northridge. She was \nsupporting herself then by scrubbing floors and cleaning houses in Malibu. \n\n\nTonight, Voss returns in triumph as the titular heroine of Puccini's \"Turandot\" \nfor Opera Pacific at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. \n\n\nIt has been a long journey, even though Voss had come to those 1987 auditions \nnot as a rank amateur. She had understudied Ghena Dimitrova as Turandot for \nMichigan Opera Theater and Martina Arroyo in the same role for Dayton Opera \nAssn. (Both organizations are run by Opera Pacific's general director David \nDiChiera.) \n\n\nShe also had the uncommon blessing of legendary soprano Birgit Nilsson, who \ndescribed her, according to press material, as belonging \"to the group of \ndramatic sopranos that is very rare today.\" \n\n\nBut despite all, a career nearly didn't happen. Faced with the problems of an \nolder artist trying to make a career -- Voss is now in her early 40s -- she had \nabandoned singing for several years. \n\n\nShe had trained at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio in the early \n1970s, ventured a short stint in Europe, then came to UCLA to work with Jan \nPopper, director of the opera workshop program there. \n\n\n\"But that didn't work out,\" Voss said in a recent interview at a Costa Mesa \nrestaurant. \"One thing led to another. It just didn't work out . . . \n\n\n\"That's when I started the governess work (in Malibu) and all that sort of \nthing. After a while, I just let singing go. And that probably was what was my \nsaving grace because if I had been singing . . . I may not have been able to do \nwhat I'm doing now. I may have been burned out. Now there's the freshness, the \nenthusiasm that's there because now I'm coming at it in a different respect. \nNow I want to do it. Before I felt I had to do it.\" \n\n\nVoss credits basso Giorgio Tozzi and his wife -- they met through a church in \nMalibu -- for getting her back on track. \"They were so very gracious in helping \nme,\" she said. \"They believed in me and basically gave me the encouragement and \nnurturing to convince me that I could have a major career, that there was no \nreason why I had quit.\" \n\n\nNow she is enthusiastic that she is at last earning a living through her \nsinging. \n\n\n\"I crossed that barrier after I did the Charleston 'Rusalka' at the Spoleto \nFestival,\" she said. \"And then I went on and made the connection with Gian \nCarlo Menotti, who invited me to (sing the title role of) Strauss' 'Ariadne auf \nNaxos' in the Spoleto Festival in Melbourne, Australia. And from that moment on \nI was able to pretty much support myself, finally.\" \n\n\nBut just as these major breaks were occurring, personal tragedy struck. While \nshe was singing Turandot for Arizona Opera, her father suffered the first in a \nseries of heart attacks. An only child, Voss moved back home -- a small town \noutside Pittsburgh -- last October to help her mother take care of him. He died \nin January. \n\n\n\"It was a slow demise,\" Voss said. \"A textbook case of everything (bad) that \ncould possibly happen to a heart patient . . . \n\n\n\"He never got to see me on stage, which I regret deeply, but I always had \nlittle tapes and things -- pictures -- from performances that I would show him. \nAnd I was grateful that before he passed away he was able to see some success \ncoming my way.\" \n\n\nShe is scheduled to sing Chrysothemis in Strauss' \"Elektra\" next season with \nthe Los Angeles Music Center Opera, and other possibilities lie ahead. But she \nhasn't forgotten the difficulty of starting a career. \n\n\n\"Unfortunately, it is still hard for the older singers,\" she said. \"I don't \nknow if that's going to change. I've often thought if ever I'm able to be in a \nposition in some later years, that maybe there's something I could do . . . \n\n\n\"It's important that people realize that it doesn't just happen. And I'm glad \nthat I had the struggle that I had because I'm enjoying it now so much more \nthan if it had been handed to me. And maybe that helps me as an artist, too.\" \n\n\n Ealynn Voss will sing the title role in Puccini's \"Turandot\" for Opera Pacific \nat 8 p.m. today and at 2 p.m. March 4 at the Orange County Performing Arts \nCenter, 600 Town Center Drive, in Costa Mesa.

Hammerman will take over the management of the Grove \nShakespeare Festival.", "text": "The Grove Shakespeare Festival has named an insider, Barbara G. Hammerman, to \nreplace departing managing director Richard A. Stein, who was hired earlier \nthis month as chief executive of the Laguna Playhouse. \n\n\nHammerman will take over the management of the county's third-largest nonprofit \ntheater operation -- and the second-leading professional troupe after South \nCoast Repertory -- in the newly created position of executive vice president. \n\n\nHammerman said Wednesday that she will give up her unpaid post as \npresident-elect of the Grove board of directors but will retain a seat on the \nboard in her paid managerial job. Stein was not a member of the board. However, \nhis job was full time. Hers is not -- at least officially -- though her \nundisclosed salary is expected to match Stein's, she said, because \"I am \nassuming the same duties.\" \n\n\nThe 42-year-old Yorba Linda resident will be responsible for the Grove's \nfinancial management, fund raising, marketing and public relations. She said \nshe anticipates putting in \"at least 30 hours a week and probably a lot more\" \nat the theater, while also retaining \"a working relationship\" with the \nTustin-based Community Foundation of the Jewish Federation of Orange County, \nwhich she has headed since June 1986 as executive director. \n\n\n\"I think it's going to be great,\" she said of her new appointment, which takes \neffect March 5. \"I think the answer to whether (having two jobs) will succeed \nwill come in the proof of the work.\" \n\n\nThomas F. Bradac, the Grove's artistic director, said he is \"extremely pleased\" \nby the board's decision to hire from within, comparing Hammerman's elevation \nand Stein's departure to \"a baseball trade\" in which \"both teams did well.\" \n\n\n\"My concern was that getting somebody from the outside would take a three- to \nsix-month search,\" Bradac said. \"Breaking in that person in terms of learning \nthe ropes in the county would have taken another nine months. Barbara already \nknows everybody in the county. She is well connected. She knows where the money \nis. She knows who's giving and who's not.\" \n\n\nHammerman, who holds a law degree, was responsible for fund development and \ngrant programs at the Community Foundation, which has assets of almost $5 \nmillion, in addition to executive management. She has been a publicly elected \nmember of the board of trustees of the North Orange County Community College \nDistrict since 1983. \n\n\nA native of Baton Rouge, La., Hammerman has an undergraduate degree in theater \narts from Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, La., where she grew \nup. She is married and has a 14-year-old daughter. \n\n\nTo adjust for the somewhat unusual, part-time arrangement at the Grove, she \nsaid she will collaborate with three outside consultants: \n\n\n* Judith Rosenthal, a certified public accountant from Laguna Beach and former \nchief financial officer of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, who will \nassist with fiscal management. \n\n\n* Dede Ginter of Ginter & Assoc., a public relations firm in Fullerton, who \nwill assist with promotion. \n\n\n* Patti Negrino, a marketing executive from Garden Grove, who will assist with \nmarketing and development. \n\n\nThe 11-year-old Grove Shakespeare Festival, which has projected a 1990 \noperating budget of $700,000, will produce a six-play, indoor-outdoor season \nfrom May to December at the 178-seat Gem Theatre and the 550-seat Festival \nAmphitheatre.
